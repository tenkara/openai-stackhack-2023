      "Overview: We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body.  One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching.\n",
      "Symptoms: Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back. You may also have feelings in your legs or arms: Uncontrolled peeing or pooping, or inability to pee, and muscle weakness could mean a serious problem like spinal cord compression. Call your doctor right away.\n",

One minute you're sitting comfortably in front of the TV, and the next you try to stand up, and -- ouch! -- a sharp pain radiates through your lower back. Could you have a slipped or herniated disk? You might. The adult spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae. Some of the vertebrae are cushioned by soft disks made of a jellylike substance. These disks allow you to move your spine around and bend over. But if a disk between two vertebrae starts slipping out of place, it can irritate the surrounding nerves and cause extreme pain. The condition is called a slipped, ruptured, or herniated disk.\n",

Although herniated disks can happen in any part of your spine, they are most common in the lower part of your backbone (the lumbar spine), just above your hips. The pain may spread from your back to your buttocks, thighs, and even to your calves.Discomfort from a herniated disk usually gets worse when you're being active and lessens when you're resting. Even coughing, sneezing, and sitting can worsen your symptoms because they put pressure on pinched nerves. A herniated disk also can give you a feeling of tingling or numbness. The affected part of your back may also feel weak. Age also plays a role. As you get older, your disks tend to break down and lose their cushioning. That makes a herniated disk more likely.\n",
