A1AT Deficiency,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency-rare,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it’s passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight.You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you’ll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through.","You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get it between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also could start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe.You may also get a lot of lung infections. Other warning signs include: If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you could have symptoms like: A newborn baby might have: It’s rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency runs in families. If you have it, you got it from faulty genes that both your parents passed down to you. Some people get the genes but don't have any symptoms. Or they have a mild version of the disease. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. That buildup in your liver causes liver disease. The shortage of AAT protein in your bloodstream leads to lung disease.","Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. You need to get blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also tests your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage.","Although there’s no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. Doctors call this augmentation therapy. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. Augmentation therapy is also called replacement therapy. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You get the treatment once a week. The replacement alpha-1 gets into your body through an IV. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. The goal of augmentation therapy is to slow or stop the damage in your lungs. It won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You’ll need these treatments for the rest of your life. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. Doctors call this a bronchodilator, meaning that it opens your airways. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor will also give you a referral for pulmonary rehab to help you breathe better."

Abdominal Migraine,https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/cyclic-vomiting-migraines,"    Migraines are the kind of headaches that are most likely to make you nauseated. Of people who have migraines, 8 out of 10 have nausea with them too.  Research shows women and anyone prone to motion sickness are more apt to have nausea with migraines. It’s not clear why women are more affected than men, but some experts think it’s linked to changes in hormones. You can also get migraines during pregnancy. You might have pain on one side of your head and you may be nauseated. If you had migraines before you were pregnant, you may have fewer migraines while expecting. Or, you may notice an uptick in your number of headaches.Cyclic vomiting syndrome(CVS). This gastrointestinal (GI) disorder is linked to migraine headaches, but it’s not a type of migraine. It happens most often in children, though kids usually outgrow them by the time they're teenagers. Some kids with CVS go on to have migraines as adults. You’re more likely to develop CVS as an adult if you have a history of migraines or long-term marijuana use, or you’re prone to motion sickness. Triggers include hot weather, physical or emotional stress, and sinus or respiratory infections. The main symptoms of CVS are sudden episodes of severe nausea and vomiting. These attacks can last for a few hours or several days. You might vomit several times an hour.  Between episodes, you may feel healthy and have no symptoms. Doctors might misdiagnose your CVS as food poisoning or stomach flu. ",,Some less common causes may include:,,"Some things that might help include: Headache and nausea are common, and they can happen to you at the same time.  Experts don’t know why they seem to be more likely in some people.

"Absence of Menstruation, Primary",https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/absence-periods,"Amenorrhea is when you aren’t getting your periods even though you’ve been through puberty, aren’t pregnant, and haven’t gone through menopause. It’s not about having irregular periods. If you have amenorrhea, you never get your period. Although it’s not a disease, you should tell your doctor about it because it might be a symptom of a medical condition that can be treated.","Besides not having your period, there are some other symptoms you may have, depending on the cause of your amenorrhea:","Many things could cause amenorrhea. Possible causes of primary amenorrhea (when you never get your first period) include: In many cases, doctors don’t know why a first period never happens. Common causes of secondary amenorrhea (when someone who has had normal periods stops getting them) include: Other causes of secondary amenorrhea include: If you've had your uterus or ovaries removed, you will also stop menstruating.","Because many things can cause amenorrhea, it may take time to find the exact cause. Your doctor will first take your medical history and give you a physical and pelvic exam. If you’re sexually active, they might first order a pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy as a cause. It may take several kinds of tests to find out what’s causing your amenorrhea. Your doctor may use one or more of the following: Blood tests. These measure the levels of certain hormones in your blood, including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and male hormones. Too much or too little of these hormones can interfere with the menstrual cycle. Imaging tests. These tests can show abnormalities of your reproductive organs or the location of tumors. The tests include ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hormone challenge test. Your doctor will give you a hormonal medication that should cause menstrual bleeding when you stop taking it. If you don’t, this can mean that a lack of estrogen is behind your amenorrhea.Hysteroscopy. Your doctor will put a small lighted camera through your vagina and cervix to look at the inside of your uterus. Genetic screening. Looks for genetic changes that can stop your ovaries from working, and for X chromosomes that are partly or completely missing (Turner’s syndrome). Chromosome tests (karyotype). Identifies missing, extra, or rearranged cells in your chromosomes to help pinpoint abnormalities that can cause amenorrhea.","Treatment for amenorrhea will focus on the condition that causes it. Hormone replacement therapy or birth control pills can help start your menstrual cycle again. A thyroid or pituitary disorder can be treated with medication. Physical abnormalities may need surgery.

Absence Seizure,https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/understanding-absence-seizure-basics,"Affecting about two of every 1,000 people, absence seizures (formerly called ''petit mal'' seizures) are caused by abnormal and intense electrical activity in the brain. Normally, the brain's nerve cells (neurons) communicate with one another by firing tiny electric signals. But with a seizure, these signals become abnormal. Seizures may affect an isolated part of the brain or may involve abnormal activity in the whole brain (called generalized seizures). Absence seizures are one form of generalized seizure. They typically are brought on by exertion of some sort. Typically, this type of seizure lasts between 10 and 30 seconds. The person, most often a child aged 5 to 15, abruptly stops whatever they're doing (talking, walking) and appears to ""stare into space."" Absence seizures rarely cause a true convulsion in which the person falls down or collapses. Despite briefly losing consciousness, the person recovers fully with no lingering confusion or other ill effects. These ""spells"" may occur infrequently or several times per hour. In children, absence seizures may interfere with learning and are often misinterpreted as daydreaming or inattention. About a quarter of people who have absence seizures will develop another type of generalized seizure called tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called ''grand mal'' seizures). The vast majority of children, however, will outgrow them.",,"Scientists are unsure of the underlying reasons for absence seizures; however, some research suggests that genetics may play a role. ",,

But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or is afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up.

Acantholysis Bullosa,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/epidermolysis-bullosa-what-is,"There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth.","Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers. Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder. If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.","Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system.","To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.","There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth.","Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers. Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder. If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.","Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system.","To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.","There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."

They'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer. These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster. Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests:  ","The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments. When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. They'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor. Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them. Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area. Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed.If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if they're worried the cancer has spread somewhere they haven't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds: Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth. Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what they can do to help you with them."

A baby may be born with a patch of skin that is like an open wound or an ulcer. Often this defect occurs at the back of the scalp, at the center of the ""whorl pattern"" of hair growth. If the defect is small, the skin will scab over and the baby is left with a scar. Sometimes this happens in the womb and all that can be seen at birth is a patch of scalp where there are no hair follicles. However, if a baby is born with a large congenital aplasia, it usually requires an operation to cut out the affected area and close up the skin. This is often done with some urgency, since the open wound is a site of potential hemorrhage and infection. The quicker the defect heals, the better.",,,,
ACH,https://www.webmd.com/children/dwarfism-causes-treatments,"Dwarfism is when a person is short in stature because of their genes or a medical reason. It’s defined by the advocacy groups Little People of the World Organization (LPOTW) and Little People of America (LPA) as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches or under, as a result of a medical or genetic condition. Other groups extend the criteria for certain forms of dwarfism to 5 feet, but the average height of an adult with dwarfism is 4 feet. There are two main categories of dwarfism -- disproportionate and proportionate. Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by an average-size torso and shorter arms and legs or a shortened trunk with longer limbs. In proportionate dwarfism, the body parts are in proportion but shortened.","In addition to short stature, dwarfism has many other symptoms that can vary depending the type it is. Disproportionate dwarfism symptoms Disproportionate dwarfism usually doesn’t affect intellectual development unless a child has other rare conditions, including hydrocephalus, or excess fluid around the brain.Symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism may include: Some people with disproportionate dwarfism have a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Adults with SEDC are around 3 to 4 feet tall and may have these signs too: Proportionate dwarfism symptoms","There are approximately 400 types of dwarfism. Causes of proportionate dwarfism include metabolic and hormonal disorders such as growth hormone deficiency. The most common types of dwarfism, known as skeletal dysplasias, are genetic. Skeletal dysplasias are conditions of abnormal bone growth that cause disproportionate dwarfism. They include: Achondroplasia. The most common form of dwarfism -- accounting for 70% of cases -- achondroplasia occurs in about one out of 26,000 to 40,000 babies and is evident at birth. People with achondroplasia have a relatively long trunk and shortened upper parts of their arms and legs. Other features of achondroplasia include:Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias (SED).A less common form of dwarfism, SED affects approximately one in 95,000 babies. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia refers to a group of conditions characterized by a shortened trunk, which may not become apparent until a child is between ages 5 and 10. Other features can include: Diastrophic dysplasia.A rare form of dwarfism, diastrophic dysplasia occurs in about one in 100,000 births. People who have it tend to have shortened forearms and calves (this is known as mesomelic shortening). Other signs can include Turner syndrome.This genetic condition only affects females. It’s caused by a missing or partial X chromosome. Girls with Turner syndrome only inherit one fully functioning X chromosome from their parents, instead of one from each parent.","Some forms of dwarfism are evident in utero, at birth, or during infancy and can be diagnosed through X-rays and a physical exam. A diagnosis of achondroplasia, diastrophic dysplasia, or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia can be confirmed through genetic testing. In some cases, prenatal testing is done if there is concern for specific conditions. Sometimes dwarfism doesn't become evident until later in a child's life, when dwarfism signs lead parents to seek a diagnosis. Here are signs and symptoms to look for in children that indicate a potential for dwarfism: Doctors may also use these tests to help diagnose dwarfism: Appearance. Children with possible dwarfism may have changes to their skeleton or facial structures as they develop. Chart comparisons. At regular check-ups, your child’s height, weight, and head circumference will be measured and compared to percentiles for standard development for their age. If your child shows any signs of abnormal growth, they may need more frequent measurements. Imaging.Doctors may spot signs of achondroplasia, such as shorter limbs, or other causes of dwarfism on ultrasounds of a fetus during pregnancy. X-rays of babies or children may show that their arms or legs are not growing at a normal rate, or that their skeleton shows signs of dysplasia. MRI scans can show any abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, which affect hormone production.Genetic testing.DNA tests may be done before or after birth to look for genetic mutations linked to dwarfism. Girls with suspected Turner syndrome may need DNA tests to check their X chromosomes. DNA testing may help parents with family planning if they wish to have more children. Family history.Pediatricians may check the height and size of other family members, such as siblings, to compare with the child with suspected dwarfism. Hormone tests.Tests of growth hormone levels can confirm if they’re low.","Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or lessen some of the problems associated with dwarfism. People with dwarfism related to growth hormone deficiency can be treated with growth hormone. For children five years of age and older with achondroplasia who still have the potential for growth, the FDA has approved vosoritide (Voxzogo) to help stimulate bone growth. In many cases, people with dwarfism have orthopaedic or medical complications. Treatment of those can include: Other treatment may include:"
Achalasia,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/achalasia-what-to-know,"Achalasia happens when the processes that move food to your stomach don’t work like they should. For food and liquids to pass from your mouth to your stomach, two things have to happen after you swallow. First, the esophagus, the tube that carries food to your stomach, has to move the food along by squeezing and relaxing. Once the food reaches the stomach, a small muscle flap or valve at the bottom of the esophagus must open to let the food empty into the stomach.  If you have achalasia, neither of these processes works well. The esophagus can’t push food down. Also, the valve doesn’t open up completely. This causes food to get caught at the base of the esophagus, like a clogged sink, and wash up back into your mouth. Achalasia is rare. Approximately 1 in 100,000 people will get it. It can take years to develop, and some people ignore the symptoms for years before they go to a doctor.  Although the condition can’t be cured, treatment will help you live with it.",The biggest symptom of achalasia is trouble swallowing liquids and solid food. People with the condition may also have: Eating within 4 hours of going to bed may make symptoms worse. Foods such as meat and bread may also cause trouble.,"People of all races can get achalasia. It’s found equally in men and women. It mainly happens in people 30 to 60 years old, although sometimes children have it. Achalasia is sometimes seen in people with Down syndrome.","Because the symptoms of achalasia are so much like heartburn, your doctor may treat you for heartburn first. If that doesn’t work, they probably will test you for achalasia.They may look down into your throat with a special tool called an endoscope. It has a tiny camera attached to a long tube so the doctor can see down your esophagus.  The barium swallow test is a common screening test for achalasia. So is a test called manometry. A doctor runs a thin tube down your throat to test the strength of the esophagus muscles as you take sips of water. It also measures how well your stomach valve works.","Surgery Surgery is the most successful achalasia treatment. With surgery, most people will get long-term relief from symptoms. The most common procedure is called a Heller myotomy. Most of the time it’s done using a scope with a camera and a light, along with other instruments. The doctor makes several tiny cuts into the abdomen, and uses the surgical tools to reach the area they need to work on. The goal of the operation is to open part of the lower esophagus to make swallowing easier. It’s usually very successful.Another surgical option is called peroral endoscopic myotomy, or POEM. With this procedure, doctors don’t have to cut outside the body. Instead, the doctor inserts an endoscope (a small tool with a camera on the end) into the mouth and down the throat. Once they see inside, they make a small cut to the internal lining of your esophagus. They tunnel through it to reach the inner muscle of the lower esophagus, where they make another cut. This helps make swallowing easier. Both these surgeries are usually successful. But they can cause acid reflux in some people who have it done. Your doctor will discuss which procedure might be best for you. Other Treatments You may not need surgery for achalasia. There are things that can help, but they usually don’t work as well. And you may need to go in for multiple procedures. Some options are: Injections of muscle-relaxing medicine. Your doctor injects Botox (botulinum toxin) into the tight esophagus muscles. This helps relax the muscles temporarily so you can swallow normally."
Achilles Tendon Problems,https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/achilles-tendon-injury,"An Achilles tendon injury can happen to anyone, whether you’re an athlete or just going about your everyday life. The Achilles tendon is the largest tendon in your body. It stretches from the bones of your heel to your calf muscles. You can feel it: a springy band of tissue at the back of your ankle and above your heel. It lets you point your toes toward the floor and raise up on your tiptoes. It’s common for this tendon to get injured. It can be mild or moderate and feel like a burning pain or stiffness in that part of your leg. If the pain is severe, your Achilles tendon may be partly or completely torn. Achilles tendinitis is another type of injury in which some part of your tendon is inflamed. There are two main types of this condition, which affect different parts of your tendon:","The most obvious sign is pain above your heel, especially when you stretch your ankle or stand on your toes. It may be mild and get better or worse over time. If the tendon ruptures, the pain is instant and severe. The area may also feel tender, swollen, and stiff. If your Achilles tendon tears, you may hear a snapping or popping noise when it happens. You could have bruising and swelling, too. You also may have trouble pointing your toes and pushing off your toes when you take a step.",These things may make you more likely to get an Achilles tendon injury:,"Doctors sometimes mistake an Achilles tendon injury for sprained ankle. To make the right diagnosis, your doctor will start with a physical exam. They may want to see you walk or run so they can look for problems that might have led to your injury. They also might do something called the calf squeeze test. You'll kneel on a chair or bench or lie on your stomach on the exam table. Your doctor will gently squeeze the calf muscle on your healthy leg. This will pull on the tendon and make your foot move. Next, they’ll do the same thing on your other leg. If your Achilles tendon is torn, your foot won't move, because your calf muscle won't be connected to your foot. Your doctor may test your range of motion to see if you can move your ankle the way you should. They may also do imaging tests, such as X-ray or MRI. These tests can show what kind of tendon damage you have and help them decide on the best treatment for you.","Minor to moderate Achilles tendon injuries should heal on their own.

Acquired Lipodystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/acquired-lipodystrophy,"However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications. And cosmetic surgery might be an option if looks are a concern.","While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: AGL. They'll lose fat from under the skin all over their body, including their face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of their feet. They could look very muscular, and you’ll be able to see veins under their skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. They could have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They'll probably have extra hair on their upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet.Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in their body or controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. They could have a large liver or spleen. APL. This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with their face and moves to their neck, arms, and chest. Localized. This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps.","Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often.","When you go to the doctor, they'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child’s health:Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Blood tests check: If the doctor suspects APL, they'll check their blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems.","Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse.Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, they may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out their face with skin grafts from their thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for their appearance makes sense and when."

Children can have problems with too much growth hormone -- a condition called gigantism. There are treatments for acromegaly, and every case is different. In most cases, it might be years before you notice symptoms.","Changes happen slowly, sometimes over years. Your hands and feet are usually large. You might notice a change in your ring or shoe size, especially your shoe width. The features in your face -- your lips, jaw, nose, and tongue -- often change, becoming coarser and broader. Your teeth may begin to space out. Your brow and lower jaw may start to jut out from your face. Other symptoms may include:","The most common cause is a noncancerous tumor in your pituitary gland. This tumor is called a pituitary adenoma. The pituitary gland is in the skull, just below the brain. Because of the tumor, your body makes too much growth hormone. Once in a while, tumors in the pancreas, liver, or parts of the brain can cause acromegaly by producing higher levels of another hormone, called IGF-1, which causes the symptoms you see.","The sooner your acromegaly is diagnosed, the better. When you see your doctor, they'll ask you questions like these:To tell for sure if you have acromegaly, your doctor will run a few tests, including:  Other tests include:","Your doctor will work with you to come up with the best treatment plan, taking into account your age, health, and how far along your condition is. There are three ways to treat acromegaly: Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting important areas, especially if they’re pressing on nerves that harm your vision. The surgeon will remove the tumor from the base of the brain. To get to it, they'll make a small cut in your nose or the inside of your upper lip. In some cases, your doctor may have you take medicine before the surgery to shrink the tumor. After the surgery, your doctor will measure your hormones and will do imaging of the area where the tumor was removed. Your symptoms may start to get better after only a few days. Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control or cure the disease and bring hormone levels back to normal:Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block the effects it has on your body. Radiation helps if you have parts of a tumor left after surgery or if you need more help lowering growth hormone levels after taking medicine. It can help stop the tumor from growing and your body from making too much growth hormone. Types of radiation therapy include:"
Adenosine Deaminase Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID),https://www.webmd.com/children/adenosine-deaminase-severe-combined-immunodeficiency,"When you have a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), your immune system can't fight off even mild infections on its own. With adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), your body's defenses stop working because of a problem with your genes. ADA-SCID is a serious disease that usually shows up early in life. Treatments can help, though, and people who get treatment before an infection happens can live long, healthy lives. Everyone has ADA genes. If you have ADA deficiency, you have a glitch (mutation) in yours. As a result, your body doesn't make enough of a certain tool, called an enzyme, that helps your white blood cells protect you from getting sick. Without that protection, you can easily get infections. If your child is born with ADA deficiency, they'll probably get a SCID diagnosis by the time he’s 6 months old. If the disease starts later, the symptoms may be less severe. With treatment, you can manage symptoms and avoid infections. Left untreated, the body becomes less and less able to fight infections, which can be life-threatening.","Symptoms usually appear in the first months of life. If your baby has this disease, they may have a lot of infections in different parts of their body, including: It’s common for babies to get infections. Pay special attention if your child has them often and they: Children with ADA-SCID often have diarrhea and widespread skin rashes. They may also grow slowly and have delayed progress in other development areas like motor and social skills. If the disease doesn’t appear until later in childhood or adulthood, the symptoms may be mild at first. The first symptoms may be ear or upper-respiratory infections that keep coming back.","You get ADA-SCID only if both your parents pass on a copy of a faulty gene to you. If you get a copy from just one parent, you won't get the disorder, but you can pass that copy on to your own children.","Your chances of living well are best with early diagnosis and treatment. Some states screen all newborns for ADA-SCID, and many experts say early testing should be required in all states. You can be checked at any age. A doctor will take a blood sample and test it to see if the immune system is working right. Sometimes the doctor needs to do more than one blood test to diagnose ADA-SCID. Your doctor will want to know: If you find out you or your child has ADA-SCID, your doctor may talk with you about genetic counseling and early blood testing of all your children.","You'll want to start treatment right away. Find a specialist who treats immune deficiencies. Your doctor will prescribe antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral medications to treat any existing infections. Your doctor may also prescribe antibiotics to prevent new infections. A baby or child with ADA-SCID may need to spend some time in an isolated hospital room, but their parents will be able to be with them. Although it doesn’t cure the disease, enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) may help your immune system work better and prevent infections. In this therapy, you get injections of healthy enzymes, usually from a cow. The only way to cure ADA-SCID is with a stem cell transplant. Doctors will put healthy stem cells into your body to try to rebuild your immune system. It’s most successful in infants, and when the donor stem cells come from a close relative. In some cases, people need chemotherapy before getting a transplant to kill damaged cells first. Scientists are looking for more ways to treat ADA-SCID. Studies using gene therapy show promise. In these studies, researchers add healthy genes to your own cells in a lab and transplant them back into your body to correct faulty cells."
Aganglionic Megacolon,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-hirschsprungs-disease,"It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy. Usually, as the baby develops, nerve cells are created throughout the entire digestive system, from the esophagus -- which leads from the mouth to the stomach -- all the way to the rectum. Normally, a person will have up to 500 million of these types of nerve cells. Among other roles, they move food through your digestive system from one end to the other. In a baby with Hirschsprung’s, the nerve cells stop growing at the end of the large intestine, just before the rectum and anus. In some children, the cells are missing at other places in the digestive system as well. That means the body can’t sense when waste material reaches a certain point. So the waste material gets stuck and forms a block in the system. Hirschsprung’s disease affects about one in every 5,000 newborns. Children with other congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome and heart defects, are more likely to have the disease. Parents who carry the code for Hirschsprung’s disease in their genes, especially mothers, may pass it on to their children. Boys get it more than girls. The disease is named after the 19th-century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888.","For the vast majority of people with Hirschsprung’s disease, symptoms usually begin within the first 6 weeks of life. In many cases, there are signs within the first 48 hours. You may see swelling in your child’s abdomen. Other symptoms you might see include: No bowel movements: You should be concerned if the newborn does not produce a stool or the meconium in the first couple of days. Older children with Hirschsprung’s may have chronic (ongoing) constipation. Bloody diarrhea: Children with Hirschsprung’s may also get enterocolitis, a life-threatening infection of the colon, and have bad cases of diarrhea and gas. Vomiting: The vomit may be green or brown. In older children, symptoms may include growth issues, fatigue, and severe constipation.","It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy.

The disease is named after the 19th-century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888.","Your doctor should be told at once if your child has these symptoms. They can confirm Hirschsprung’s with some specific tests: A contrast enema: It’s also called a barium enema, after the element in the dye often used to coat and highlight the inside of the body’s organs. Your child is placed face-down on a table while the dye is inserted via a tube from the anus into the intestines. No anesthesia (a medication to numb or block pain) is necessary. The dye allows the doctor to see problem areas on the X-rays.The contrast enema is done as part of what is called a “lower GI series,” a group of tests on the gastrointestinal tract. An abdominal X-ray: This is a standard X-ray, which the technician may take from several angles. Your doctor will be able to see whether something is blocking the intestines. A biopsy: Your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from your child’s rectum. The tissue will be looked at for signs of Hirschsprung’s. Depending on the age and size of your child, the doctor may use anesthesia. Anorectal manometry: This test inflates a small balloon inside the rectum to see whether the muscles of the area respond. This test is done only on older children.","Hirschsprung’s disease is a very serious condition. But if found quickly, it can help your child live a relatively normal life. Doctors will usually do one of two types of surgery: Pull-through procedure: This surgery simply cuts out the part of the large intestine with the missing nerve cells. Then the rest of the intestine is connected directly to the anus.Ostomy surgery: This surgery routes the intestine to an opening made in the body. The doctor then attaches an ostomy bag to the outside of the opening to hold the waste from the intestine. Ostomy surgery is usually a temporary measure until the child is ready for the pull-through procedure. After surgery, some children may have issues with constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence (lack of control over bowel movements or urination). A handful may get enterocolitis. Signs include rectal bleeding, fever, vomiting, and a swollen abdomen. If that happens, take your child to the hospital at once. But with proper care -- especially a proper diet and plenty of water -- these conditions should subside and most children are able to experience normal bowel movements within a year of treatment. Other children will have bowel issues on and off into adulthood throughout their lives. Because Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital, it means it is a lifelong issue that should be monitored.It’s a cycle that’s vital to life -- we eat food, digest it, and excrete what we can’t use. Excretion, though often a subject of disgust or humor, is very important. It usually begins on the first day of a baby’s life, when the newborn passes their first stool, called the meconium. But some babies have trouble. If a baby can’t have a bowel movement, they may have Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition in which there are missing nerve cells in the large intestine. Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital -- that is, it develops during pregnancy and is present at birth. Some congenital conditions happen because of the mother’s diet, or because of an illness they had during their pregnancy. Others are because of genes the parents pass on to the newborn. Researchers don’t know why some people have Hirschsprung’s disease, though they believe the disease is related to flaws in DNA instructions. Though the disease can be deadly, modern medicine is able to fix the problem with surgery, and help children who have been treated to live relatively normal, healthy lives."

Sometimes your therapist may suggest exposure therapy, in which you gradually start to do some of the things that make you anxious. Medicine. There are many drugs that your doctor might suggest for agoraphobia, but the most common are antidepressants. Doctors often start with a low dose of one of these medicines that raises the level of a ""feel-good"" chemical in your brain called serotonin. Some medications that help balance serotonin are citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor). You'll probably take medicine for at least 6 months to a year.

Newborns with this form of the syndrome may pee very often and can have:  ","Genes carry instructions that help your body work right. Genetic diseases can happen when there's a change in the gene (called a mutation). At least five genes are linked to Bartter syndrome, and they all play an important role in how your kidneys work -- especially in your ability to take in salt. Losing too much salt through pee (salt wasting) can affect how your kidneys take in other substances, including potassium and calcium. A lack of balance in these elements can lead to serious problems:  ","For children with symptoms of classic Bartter syndrome, a doctor will do a thorough exam along with blood and urine tests. The antenatal form can be diagnosed before birth by testing the amniotic fluid in the womb. Genetic testing may also be done. Your child's doctor will take blood and possibly small samples of tissue so a specialist can look for mutations. Once your child is diagnosed, their care may involve a team of specialists, including pediatricians, kidney experts, and social workers. To make sure they keep a healthy balance of fluids and other important things, one or several of these may be recommended: Because there's no cure, people who have Bartter syndrome will need to take certain medications or supplements for life.Bartter syndrome is a group of similar rare conditions that affect the kidneys. It's genetic, which means it's caused by a problem with a gene. If you have it, too much salt and calcium leave your body when you pee. It also may cause low levels of potassium and high levels of acid in the blood. If all these are out of balance, you can have many different health problems. There are two major forms of Bartter syndrome. Antenatal Bartter syndrome starts before birth. It can be very serious, even life threatening. Babies may not grow as they should in the womb, or they may be born too early. The other form is called classic. It usually starts in early childhood and isn't as severe as the antenatal form. But it can affect growth and cause developmental delays. Gitelman syndrome is a subtype of Bartter syndrome.

Alexander Disease,https://www.webmd.com/brain/leukodystrophy-types,"The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.","The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath.

One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it.

But it can be treated and hair can grow back. If you have it, there are several things to try: Corticosteroids. These are anti-inflammatory drugs that are prescribed for autoimmune diseases. They can be given as an injection into the scalp or other areas. They can also be given as a pill or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. The downside is that it may take a long time to work. Topical immunotherapy. This is used when there’s a lot of hair loss or if it happens more than once. Chemicals are applied to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back.

Alpha-1,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency-rare,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it’s passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight.You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you’ll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups.

For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage.","Although there’s no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage.

What experts do know is that the higher you go, the greater the odds of getting a headache. You can cut your chances if you gradually get your body used to the higher elevation. For example, if you live at sea level, you're more likely to get a headache when you travel to 8,500 feet than someone who already lives at the base of the mountain at, say, 5,000 feet. How fast you go up a peak matters, too. An 8-minute ski lift to the top of the mountain is more likely to give you a headache than a leisurely hike over several days that climbs to the same height. Just beware of pushing yourself too hard at higher altitudes, as with running, climbing, or skiing, which also raises your headache risk. ","Moderate headache pain typically starts as you get up to around 8,500 feet, most often on both sides of the head. You might notice that it worsens as you go higher or when you cough, push yourself hard, or bend over. Another clue that higher altitude caused your headache is that it goes away within 24 hours of getting back below 8,200 feet.

It can feel like a heart attack, with pressure or squeezing in your chest. It’s sometimes called angina pectoris or ischemic chest pain. It's a symptom of heart disease, and it happens when something blocks your arteries or there's not enough blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a sign of a life-threatening heart problem. It's important to find out what's going on and what you can do to avoid a heart attack. Usually, medicine and lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need what’s called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries. There are different types of angina: Stable angina. This is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.Unstable angina. You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away. Microvascular angina. With this type, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren’t working the way they should, so your heart doesn’t get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women. Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina). This type is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.","Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may have:You might mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas. You’re likely to have pain behind your breastbone, which can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back. Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. It’s an emergency that needs medical help right away.","Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at higher risk of angina, including: ","Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, risk factors, and family history. They might need to do tests including:Angina questions for your doctor ","Your treatment depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help their blood flow better and control their symptoms. Medicines Your doctor might prescribe medicines including: Cardiac procedures If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:Angioplasty/stenting. The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You’ll probably stay overnight at the hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels. You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this.

Genetic testing can usually identify Apert syndrome or another cause of abnormal skull formation.,"Apert syndrome has no known cure. Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months.2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too. Other Apert syndrome treatments include: Other surgeries may be beneficial for certain children with Apert syndrome, depending on their individual pattern of facial bone formation problems."

But you’re more likely to have symptoms of a blood clot if you:","Blood clots are the most common symptom of APS. Depending on where in your body a clot forms, it can cause different kinds of damage.Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that commonly occurs in the deep veins of the leg (the ones closest to the bones), which carry a lot of blood to the heart. A clot here can break off and cause all sorts of serious problems. DVT can also occur in other areas, such as the arms and pelvis. APS causes 15% to 20% of deep-vein thrombosis cases. Brain clots in the blood vessels of the brain can also cause headaches, dementia, seizures, and strokes. Clots that travel to the lungs can cause a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary embolism). And a clot in the heart can cause a blockage in the arteries there, heart valve damage, chest pain, and heart attack. APS affects five times as many women as men. Because it primarily hits women in their 30s, it’s also linked to pregnancy complications. Women with APS can have a hard time getting pregnant, and blood clots that form in the placenta can cause miscarriage, premature birth, and development issues with babies.",,,"Blood thinners, which also are called anticoagulants, are one option against clots. Your doctor will first treat a clot with injected and then oral medication. To prevent another clot from happening again, some people have to take oral blood thinners for longer periods of time. Pregnant women with APS get injections of blood thinners and low doses of aspirin for the entire pregnancy, up until just before delivery. Then they continue treatment after the baby is born. It’s also important to treat any other conditions that put you at risk for blood clots, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and other autoimmune disorders. You also need to stop smoking and stop estrogen therapy (either for menopause or birth control) if you have APS.It can be scary to find out that you have an autoimmune disorder with no cure.

Conditions that may produce acquired apraxia include head trauma, stroke, or a brain tumor.Experts do not yet understand what causes childhood apraxia of speech. Some scientists believe that it results from signaling problems between the brain and the muscles used for speaking. Ongoing research is focusing on whether brain abnormalities that cause apraxia of speech can be identified. Other research is looking for genetic causes of apraxia. Some studies are trying to determine exactly which parts of the brain are linked to the condition.","There is not a single test or procedure that is used to diagnose childhood apraxia of speech. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that speech-language pathologists have different opinions about which symptoms indicate the condition. Most experts, though, look for the presence of multiple, common apraxia symptoms. They may assess a patient's ability to repeat a word multiple times. Or they may assess whether a person can recite a list of words that are increasingly more difficult, such as ""play, playful, playfully."" A speech-language pathologist may interact with a child to assess which sounds, syllables, and words the child is able to make and understand. The pathologist will also examine the child's mouth, tongue, and face for any structural problems that might be causing apraxia symptoms.When diagnosing apraxia, experts may look for the presence of other symptoms. For instance, they may look for weakness or difficulties with language comprehension. Both of these are indicative of other conditions and their presence would help rule out apraxia. For people with possible acquired apraxia, an MRI of the brain may be useful to determine the extent and location of any brain damage. Typically, a diagnosis of childhood apraxia of speech cannot be made before a child's second birthday. Before this time, most children are unable to understand or perform the tasks needed to determine the presence of apraxia.","In some cases of acquired apraxia, the condition resolves spontaneously. This is not the case with childhood apraxia of speech, which does not go away without treatment. There are various treatment approaches used for apraxia. How effective they are can vary from person to person. For the best results, apraxia treatment must be developed to meet a given individual's needs. Most children with apraxia of speech benefit from meeting one on one with a speech-language pathologist three to five times a week. They may also need to work with their parents or guardians to practice the skills they are developing.Therapy for childhood apraxia of speech aims to improve speech coordination. Exercises may include: Many therapists believe that sign language is beneficial for children who have difficulty being understood. They often recommend that children attempt to say the words they are signing to practice making the necessary movements with their mouths. People with more extreme cases of acquired apraxia may also benefit from sign language. Or they may use assistive electronic devices, including computers that can be used to produce words and sentences. Very few studies have been done to determine the relative effectiveness of various treatment approaches for childhood apraxia of speech. This may be due, in part, to ongoing debate among experts as to which symptoms and characteristics merit a diagnosis of apraxia."
APS,https://www.webmd.com/dvt/what-is-antiphospholipid-syndrome,"About 1% to 5% of people in the United States have misbehaving antibodies (proteins) in their blood that can lead to APS. Normal antibodies fight infections, but with this condition, things called “autoantibodies” attack certain fats that help with blood clotting. And so your blood starts to clot abnormally. APS antibodies can sometimes cause:Plenty of people with the APS antibodies never have symptoms, though. For your doctor to diagnose APS, you must have both the antibodies and the symptoms. No one is certain why some people develop APS antibodies, but doctors do know that your chances are higher if you: Again, if you have the APS antibodies you might never show signs of APS. But you’re more likely to have symptoms of a blood clot if you:","Blood clots are the most common symptom of APS. Depending on where in your body a clot forms, it can cause different kinds of damage.Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that commonly occurs in the deep veins of the leg (the ones closest to the bones), which carry a lot of blood to the heart. A clot here can break off and cause all sorts of serious problems. DVT can also occur in other areas, such as the arms and pelvis. APS causes 15% to 20% of deep-vein thrombosis cases. Brain clots in the blood vessels of the brain can also cause headaches, dementia, seizures, and strokes. Clots that travel to the lungs can cause a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries (pulmonary embolism). And a clot in the heart can cause a blockage in the arteries there, heart valve damage, chest pain, and heart attack. APS affects five times as many women as men. Because it primarily hits women in their 30s, it’s also linked to pregnancy complications. Women with APS can have a hard time getting pregnant, and blood clots that form in the placenta can cause miscarriage, premature birth, and development issues with babies.",,,"Blood thinners, which also are called anticoagulants, are one option against clots. Your doctor will first treat a clot with injected and then oral medication. To prevent another clot from happening again, some people have to take oral blood thinners for longer periods of time. Pregnant women with APS get injections of blood thinners and low doses of aspirin for the entire pregnancy, up until just before delivery. Then they continue treatment after the baby is born. It’s also important to treat any other conditions that put you at risk for blood clots, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes, and other autoimmune disorders. You also need to stop smoking and stop estrogen therapy (either for menopause or birth control) if you have APS.It can be scary to find out that you have an autoimmune disorder with no cure. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is one of those, but plenty of people with APS never have symptoms, and there are very good treatments for those who do. APS is a disorder that affects how your blood clots, which can cause lots of issues in your body. It mostly affects young women, and sometimes the reason why you develop is unclear. But doctors do know a lot about how APS works and how to treat it."

If symptoms indicate the possibility of a tumor, a doctor may order a brain scan: an MRI and/or a CT scan. These will allow the doctor to locate the meningioma and determine its size. A biopsy may sometimes be performed. A surgeon removes part or all of the tumor to determine whether it is benign or malignant.","If the tumor is not causing any symptoms, observation is often recommended. Regular brain scans will be performed to determine if the tumor is growing. If the tumor's growth threatens to cause problems or if symptoms begin to develop, surgery may be necessary. If surgery is required, a craniotomy will typically be performed. The procedure involves removing a piece of bone from the skull. This gives the surgeon access to the affected portion of the brain. The surgeon then removes the tumor -- or as much of it as possible. The bone that was removed at the start of the procedure is then replaced. The location of the meningioma will determine how accessible it is to the surgeon. If it can't be reached via surgery, radiation therapy may be used. Radiation can shrink the tumor or help prevent it from growing any larger. Radiation can also be used to kill cancer cells if the tumor is malignant. It may also be used on the parts of a tumor the surgeon was unable to remove.A meningioma is a tumor that forms on membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord just inside the skull. Specifically, the tumor forms on the three layers of membranes that are called meninges. These tumors are often slow-growing. As many as 90% are benign (not cancerous). Most meningiomas occur in the brain. But they can also grow on parts of the spinal cord. Often, meningiomas cause no symptoms and require no immediate treatment. But the growth of benign meningiomas can cause serious problems. In some cases, such growth can be fatal. Meningiomas are the most common type of tumor that originates in the central nervous system. They occur more often in women than in men. Some meningiomas are classified as atypical. These are not considered either benign or malignant (cancerous). But they may become malignant. A small number of meningiomas are cancerous. They tend to grow quickly. They also can spread to other parts of the brain and beyond, often to the lungs."

In fact, the name of the chikungunya virus in the African Makonde language means ""bent over in pain.""  It's been seen in as many as 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Americas. The chikungunya virus isn't common in the U.S., compared to other countries. Cases of the virus were reported starting in 2014 among travelers returning to the U.S. from affected areas. Since then, rare cases of local transmission have been reported in Florida, Texas, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

ARDS,https://www.webmd.com/lung/ards-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition that causes fluid to build up in your lungs so oxygen can’t get to your organs. Fluid leaks from small blood vessels and collects in tiny air sacs in your lungs so they can’t fill with enough air. Because of this, your blood can’t pick up the oxygen it needs to carry to the rest of your body. Organs such as your kidneys or brain might not work the way they should or might shut down. ARDS is sometimes life-threatening and can get worse quickly. But it’s generally treatable, and most people recover. Fast diagnosis and treatment are important.",ARDS puts a lot of strain on your lungs.

"Arteritis, Takayasu",https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/takayasus-arteritis,"In the U.S. and Japan, Takayasu's arteritis is fatal in only about 3% of patients who have had the disease for an average of five years. This encouraging statistic is the product of recognizing the disease and treating it appropriately. Reports from other parts of the world have been less optimistic, possibly because it is not as readily recognized and treated.","Approximately half of all people with Takayasu's arteritis will have a sense of generalized illness. This may include low grade fevers, swollen glands, anemia, dizziness, night sweats, muscle aches, and/or arthritis. The changes that occur in Takayasu's arteritis are often gradual, allowing alternate (collateral) routes of blood flow to develop. These alternate routes are typically smaller blood vessels. The collateral vessels may not be able to carry as much blood as the normal vessels. In general, however, the blood flow that occurs beyond an area of narrowing is almost always adequate to allow tissues to survive. In rare cases, if collateral blood vessels are not available in sufficient quantity, the tissue that is normally supplied with blood and oxygen by those vessels will die. Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms or legs may cause fatigue, pain, or aching due to reduced blood supply -- especially during activities such as shampooing the hair, exercising, or walking. It is much less common for decreased blood flow to cause a stroke or a heart attack. In some people, decreased blood flow to the intestines may lead to abdominal pain, especially after meals.Decreased blood flow to the kidneys may cause high blood pressure, but rarely causes kidney failure. Some people with Takayasu's arteritis may not have any symptoms. Their diagnosis may be discovered when their doctor attempts to take their blood pressure and has trouble getting a reading in one or both arms. Similarly, a doctor may notice that the strength of pulses in the wrists, neck, or groin may not be equal, or the pulse on one side may be absent.",The exact cause of Takayasu's arteritis is unknown.,,"Corticosteroids -- often called simply ""steroids"" -- are the most common treatment for Takayasu's arteritis. Steroids work within hours after the first dose is given. While this drug often is dramatically effective, it may be only partially effective for some people. Once it is apparent that the disease is under control, doctors slowly reduce the dosage of prednisone (a steroid) to sustain improvement, thereby trying to minimize treatment side effects. In some people, it is possible to gradually discontinue medication without a relapse.As the dosage of prednisone is gradually reduced, about half of all patients will have recurrent symptoms or progression of illness. This has led researchers to explore additional treatments to produce remission. Among medications that have been tried, with varying degrees of success, are immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate. When these drugs are added to prednisone to treat Takayasu's arteritis, 50% of patients who had previously relapsed will achieve remission and be able to gradually discontinue prednisone. Overall, about 25% of patients will have disease that is not entirely controlled without continued use of these treatments. This emphasizes the need for continuing research to identify better and less toxic treatments for Takayasu's arteritis and other forms of vasculitis."
Arthritic Rheumatoid Disease,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis,"With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.  Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux.""","Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:  ",,,"There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called ""steroids"" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly."
Arthritis Urethritica,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/arthritis-reactive-arthritis,"The prognosis for reactive arthritis varies. Most people recover in three to four months, but about half have recurrences for several years. Some people develop complications that may include inflammation of the heart muscle, inflammation with stiffening of the spine, glaucoma, progressive blindness, feet abnormalities, or accumulation of fluid in the lungs.  Reactive arthritis, formerly referred to as Reiter's syndrome, is a form of arthritis that affects the joints, eyes, urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body), and skin. The disease is recognized by various symptoms in different organs of the body that may or may not appear at the same time. It may come on quickly and severely or more slowly, with sudden remissions or recurrences. Reactive arthritis primarily affects sexually active males between the ages of 20 and 40. Those with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) are at a particularly high risk.","The first symptoms of reactive arthritis are painful urination and a discharge from the penis if there is inflammation of the urethra. Diarrhea may occur if the intestines are affected. This is then followed by arthritis four to 28 days later that usually affects the fingers, toes, ankles, hips, and knee joints. Typically, only one or a few of these joints may be affected at one time. Other symptoms include:  ","The cause of reactive arthritis is still unknown, but research suggests the disease is caused, in part, by a genetic predisposition: Approximately 75% of those with the condition have a positive blood test for the genetic marker HLA-B27. In sexually active males, most cases of reactive arthritis follow infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or Ureaplasma urealyticum, both sexually transmitted diseases. In other cases, people develop the symptoms following an intestinal infection with shigella, salmonella, yersinia, or campylobacter bacteria. Besides using condoms during sexual activity, there is no known preventative measure for reactive arthritis.",,"Bacterial infections, such as chlamydia, will need to be treated with antibiotics. Joint inflammation from reactive arthritis is usually treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as naproxen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. Skin eruptions and eye inflammation can be treated with steroids. Those with chronic disease may be prescribed other medications, including methotrexate. Patients with chronic arthritis also may be referred to a physical therapist and may be advised to exercise regularly."

In addition, people with a weakened immune system and those with pre-existing conditions such as cancer, diabetes, intravenous drug abuse, and immune deficiency disorders have a higher risk of septic arthritis. In addition, previously damaged joints have an increased likelihood of becoming infected.",,"Septic arthritis treatments include using a combination of powerful antibiotics as well as draining the infected synovial fluid from the joint. It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used.

As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. The thyroid may or may not be tender to the touch.  A damaged thyroid can’t do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones. Symptoms can include:","Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes.","Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies. You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems.","The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while.

Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) causes a lot of fluid-filled sacs, called cysts, to grow in your kidneys. The cysts keep your kidneys from working as they should. That can cause health problems like high blood pressure, infections, and kidney stones. It can also cause kidney failure, although that doesn't happen to everyone. You can have ADPKD and not know it for many years. It’s often called “adult PKD,” because the symptoms don't usually appear until people reach ages 30 to 40. Over time, ADPKD can start to damage your kidneys. You can slow the damage and prevent some of the complications by making healthy habits (especially those that help you lower and then maintain your blood pressure) part of your life and taking medications as necessary. Depending on the type of ADPKD you have, you can lead an active life for many years by managing your symptoms and working with your doctor. There’s not a cure, but scientists are doing research to look for new treatments.","Not everyone with ADPKD will have symptoms. Those who do may not notice anything for many years. Most people with the disease have high blood pressure. Urinary tract infections and kidney stones are also common. Other signs that you have ADPKD include: Over time, cysts may grow big enough to damage your kidneys and, for some people, can cause them to fail. If that happens, you may have:  ","ADPKD is caused by a problem with one of two genes in your DNA -- PKD1 or PKD2. These genes make proteins in kidney cells that let them know when to grow. A problem with either gene causes kidney cells to grow out of control and form cysts.Many genetic diseases happen when a person gets broken genes from both parents, but with ADPKD, you need only one faulty gene to have the disease. That's why this kind of PKD is called “autosomal dominant,” meaning only one parent has to pass on a broken gene. If one parent has the disease, each child has a 50-50 chance of getting it. You can get ADPKD even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your PKD genes gets a defect on its own. But it’s rare for someone to get it this way.","If your doctor thinks there’s a problem with your kidneys, they may want you to see a nephrologist, a specialist who treats kidney diseases. They’ll ask you questions like:The doctor will do some tests to get images of your kidneys and check them for cysts. They may start with an ultrasound, which uses sound waves to make a picture of the inside of your body. To look for cysts that are too small for an ultrasound to find, they could also use: Doctors can also test your DNA to see if you have a broken PKD1 or PKD2 gene. But it’s important to know the limits of the test. It can show if you have the gene, but it can’t tell you when you’ll get ADPKD or how severe it will be.","There is no cure for ADPKD, but you can treat the health problems that the disease causes and possibly prevent kidney failure. You may need: If your kidneys fail, you’ll need dialysis, which uses a machine to filter your blood and remove waste, like salt, extra water, and certain chemicals. You can also get on a waiting list or receive a kidney from a living donor for a kidney transplant. Ask your doctor if that’s a good option for you.

Other possible sites are the shoulder, knees, and ankles.","In its earliest stages, AVN may have no symptoms, but as the disease progresses it typically becomes very painful. At first, it might only hurt when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become constant. If the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may have severe pain that makes you unable to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and bone collapse can range from several months to more than a year.",Things that can make avascular necrosis more likely include: Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include:,Your doctor will start with a physical exam. They’ll press on your joints to check for tender spots. They’ll move your joints through a series of positions to check your range of motion. You might get one of these imaging tests to look for what’s causing your pain:,"Treatment goals for AVN are to improve the joint, stop the bone damage, and ease pain. The best treatment will depend on a number of things, like: If you catch avascular necrosis early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee, or ankle is affected, you may need crutches to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the joint mobile."

Viruses often change over time, leading to different subtypes called strains. When bird flu infects humans, which is rare, it's most often from strains known as H5, H7, and H9. Less commonly, researchers have detected H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8 strains in humans.","Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. The illness could start out with flu-like symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. But it may worsen to include:In February 2005, researchers in Vietnam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brains and digestive tracts of two children. Both died. These cases show that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu. Scientists have identified more than a dozen different strains, or variants, of bird flu. H5N1, one of the deadliest strains for humans, has caused 456 bird flu deaths since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. ",,,"The flu drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) may help treat bird flu in people, although more studies are needed.

This could be a tablet you take by mouth or a cream or gel you put into your vagina. You'll need to take most treatments for 5 to 7 days. Finish all your medicine, even if the symptoms go away. If you stop early, the infection could come back. Since BV can be spread through sex, don’t have sexual contact until you're done taking your medicine and your symptoms are gone. If your partner is another woman, they may want to see their doctor to find out if they need treatment. Even after BV is treated and goes away, it often returns. If that happens, you'll probably need to take antibiotics again for a longer time. If you use an IUD and BV keeps coming back (recurrent BV), you may want to talk to your doctor about a different type of birth control."
Bad or Changed Breath,https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/bad-breath,"Basically, all the food eaten begins to be broken down in your mouth. Also, foods are absorbed into your bloodstream and move to the lungs, affecting the air you exhale. If you eat foods with strong odors (such as garlic or onions), brushing and flossing – even mouthwash – merely covers up the odor temporarily. The odor will not go away completely until the foods have passed through your body. Other common foods that can cause bad breath include: Likewise, dieters who don't eat often enough can have bad breath. When your body breaks down fat, the process releases chemicals that can give your breath an unpleasant smell.",,"If you don't brush and floss teeth daily, food particles can remain in your mouth, promoting bacterial growth between teeth, around the gums, and on the tongue. This causes bad breath. Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis) from poor dental hygiene can also cause bad breath. In addition, odor-causing bacteria and food particles can cause bad breath if dentures are not properly cleaned. Smoking or chewing tobacco-based products also can cause bad breath, stain teeth, reduce your ability to taste foods, and irritate your gums.",,"In most cases, your dentist can treat the cause of bad breath. If your dentist determines that your mouth is healthy and the odor is not of oral origin, you may be referred to your family doctor or to a specialist to determine the odor source and treatment plan. You can go over a list of your medications with them to see if any of them could be adding to the problem. Work with them to keep diabetes, allergies, and other conditions under control. If the odor is due to gum disease, for example, your dentist can either treat the disease or refer you to a periodontist, a dentist who specializes in treating gum conditions."
Baldness,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hair-loss/understanding-hair-loss-basics,"    Hair grows everywhere on the human skin except on places like the palms of our hands and the soles of our feet, our eyelids and belly buttons, but many hairs are so fine they're virtually invisible. Hair is made up of a protein called keratin that is produced in hair follicles in the outer layer of skin. As follicles produce new hair cells, old cells are being pushed out through the surface of the skin at the rate of about six inches a year. The hair you can see is actually a string of dead keratin cells. The average adult head has about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs and loses up to 100 of them a day; finding a few stray hairs on your hairbrush is not necessarily cause for alarm. At any one time, about 90% of the hair on a person's scalp is growing. Each follicle has its own life cycle that can be influenced by age, disease, and a wide variety of other factors. This life cycle is divided into three phases:As people age, their rate of hair growth slows. There are many types of hair loss, also called alopecia:",,"Doctors don't know why certain hair follicles are programmed to have a shorter growth period than others. However, several factors may influence hair loss:",,
Balo Disease,https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/balos-disease,Many signs of Balo’s disease are similar to MS symptoms. They can include:,Many signs of Balo’s disease are similar to MS symptoms. They can include:,"Doctors aren’t sure what triggers Balo’s disease. They think it’s a type of autoimmune condition, which is when your body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue and makes it swollen or inflamed. Some people who get Balo’s disease have an illness with a high fever and severe headaches right before they notice other symptoms. Because of this, doctors think it may be linked to an infection, though no one knows for sure.","Because Balo’s disease is very rare, it’s best to see a doctor who specializes in problems of the brain and nervous system (a neurologist). They’ll ask about your medical history and your symptoms. They’ll also give you a physical exam to see how well you move and if some of your muscles are weaker than others. And they’ll check to see how good your memory is and how well you speak.They’ll order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your brain and spinal cord to check for lesions. That uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed pictures of the inside of your body. You also may have blood tests to check for an infection, or your doctor may take a small amount of spinal fluid from your lower back for testing. In some cases, your doctor might suggest an evoked potential (EP) test. A technician will put small patches on your scalp that connect wires to a machine that measures the activity in your brain. They’ll then ask you to watch, listen, or feel certain things (like light patterns, a series of clicks, or short electrical bursts) and see how your brain responds to them.","There is no cure for Balo’s disease, and no medications have been designed to treat it. Your doctor may prescribe some of the same drugs used to treat MS along with steroids (corticosteroids) to help with swelling in your brain and spinal cord tissue. You also may get medicine to help ease pain or muscle problems, like weakness or spasms.Most doctors think of Balo’s disease as a rare form of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS attacks and damages tissue in your brain and spinal cord, which causes lesions (areas of inflamed tissue). Balo’s disease damages that tissue, too, and it causes lesions in your brain and spinal cord. The difference is that the lesions caused by MS look like blotches or spots, but the ones caused by Balo’s disease look like bull's-eye marks. Because of this, Balo’s disease is sometimes known as Balo’s concentric sclerosis -- the bull's-eye-shaped scars are concentric rings. Another difference between the two conditions is that many people who have MS have periods of time when their symptoms let up. But most people who have Balo’s disease don’t get a break from their symptoms, and their health gets worse over time. Balo’s disease is most common among Asian people, especially people from China and the Philippines. Adults are more likely to get it than children, and it can affect both men and women. People often get the disease in their 30s."
Barrett Esophagus,https://www.webmd.com/heartburn-gerd/guide/barretts-esophagus-symptoms-causes-and-treatments,"People with GERD may experience symptoms such as heartburn, a sour, burning sensation in the back of the throat, chronic cough, laryngitis, and nausea. When you swallow food or liquid, it automatically passes through the esophagus, which is a hollow, muscular tube that runs from your throat to your stomach. The lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle at the end of the esophagus where it joins the stomach, keeps stomach contents from rising up into the esophagus. The stomach produces acid in order to digest food, but it is also protected from the acid it produces. With GERD, stomach contents flow backward into the esophagus. This is known as reflux. Most people with acid reflux don't develop Barrett's esophagus. But in patients with frequent acid reflux, the normal cells in the esophagus may eventually be replaced by cells that are similar to cells in the intestine to become Barrett's esophagus.",,"No. Not everyone with GERD develops Barrett's esophagus. And not everyone with Barrett's esophagus has GERD. But long-term GERD is the primary risk factor. Anyone can develop Barrett's esophagus, but white males who have had long-term GERD are more likely than others to develop it. Other risk factors include the onset of GERD at a younger age and a history of current or past smoking.",,"There are several treatments, including surgery, that are designed specifically to focus on the abnormal tissue. They include:It's important to keep several facts in mind: A diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is not a cause for major alarm. Barrett's esophagus, however, can lead to precancerous changes in a small number of people and has an increased risk for cancer. So, a diagnosis is a reason to work with your doctor to be watchful of your health Barrett's esophagus is a potentially serious complication of GERD, which stands for gastroesophageal reflux disease. In Barrett's esophagus, normal tissue lining the esophagus -- the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach -- changes to tissue that resembles the lining of the intestine. About 10% of people with chronic symptoms of GERD develop Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus does not have any specific symptoms, although patients with Barrett's esophagus may have symptoms related to GERD. It does, though, increase the risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is a serious, potentially fatal cancer of the esophagus. Although the risk of this cancer is higher in people with Barrett's esophagus, the disease is still rare. Less than 1% of people with Barrett's esophagus develop this particular cancer. Nevertheless, if you've been diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus, it's important to have routine examinations of your esophagus. With routine examination, your doctor can discover precancerous and cancer cells early, before they spread and when the disease is easier to treat."

If you’re over 40, they may do a biopsy (take a sample of tissue from the cyst) to rule out vulvar cancer. That’s a disease that affects the lips that surround your vagina.","If your exam shows that you have an STI, or if your cyst is infected, your doctor will prescribe an antibiotic. They may also prescribe topical medications to put on your skin. If you’re under 40 and your cyst isn’t causing problems, you probably won’t need treatment.

Since vision loss is usually one of the earliest signs of the disease, eye doctors can be the first ones to suspect a problem. Multiple exams and tests might be needed before your doctor makes a diagnosis. Doctors often refer children to neurologists if they think they need more tests.There are different kinds of tests a neurologist can use to diagnose Batten disease: Tissue samples or eye exam: By examining tissue samples under a microscope, doctors can look for the buildup of certain kinds of deposits. Sometimes doctors can see these deposits just by looking into a child’s eyes. As the deposits build up over time, they can cause pink and orange circles to develop. This is called a “bull’s eye.” Blood or urine tests: Doctors can look for certain kinds of abnormalities in blood and urine samples that can indicate Batten disease. Electroencephalogram (EEG): This is a test that involves putting patches on the scalp to record the brain’s electrical currents and look for seizures. Imaging tests: CT (computed tomography) scans or MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) can help a doctor see if there are certain changes in the brain that indicate Batten disease. DNA test: If you know members of your family have Batten disease, you can get a DNA test to confirm a diagnosis.","There’s currently no known cure for any form of Batten disease, but the FDA approved an enzyme replacement therapy for CLN2 disease (TTP1 deficiency) called cerliponase alfa (Brineura) for one of the forms (CLN2 disease) in 2017.

Scientists continue to research possible treatments and therapies.Batten disease is a rare group of nervous system disorders called neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCLs) (or ceroid lipofuscinosis, neuronal: CLN) that get worse over time. It usually starts in childhood, between the ages of 5 and 10 (unless the child has the infantile or late infantile form and symptoms then usually develop before the age of 1). There are different forms of the disease but all are fatal, usually by the late teens or twenties (Children with the disease have a shortened life expectancy and the increased risk for early death depends on the form of the disease and the age of onset of the disease). The damage is caused by the buildup of fatty substances, called lipopigments, in the cells of the brain, central nervous system, and retina in the eye. Out of every 100,000 babies born in the United States, it’s estimated that about two to four have this disease that’s passed down through families. Since it’s genetic, it can affect more than one person in the same family. Both parents have to be carriers of the gene in order to pass it down.

NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis-pheochromocytoma-duodenal carcinoid syndrome, or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin. It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves.

NF2 is a rare disorder. It accounts for only 5% of acoustic neuromas. This means the vast majority are the sporadic form. Doctors aren't certain what causes the sporadic form. One known risk factor for acoustic neuroma is exposure to high doses of radiation, especially to the head and neck.",,"There are three main courses of treatment for acoustic neuroma: Observation is also called watchful waiting. Because acoustic neuromas are not cancerous and grow slowly, immediate treatment may not be necessary. Often doctors monitor the tumor with periodic MRI scans and will suggest other treatment if the tumor grows a lot or causes serious symptoms. Surgery for acoustic neuromas may involve removing all or part of the tumor. There are three main surgical approaches for removing an acoustic neuroma:Radiation therapy is recommended in some cases for acoustic neuromas. State-of-the-art delivery techniques make it possible to send high doses of radiation to the tumor while limiting expose and damage to surrounding tissue. Radiation therapy for this condition is usually delivered in one of two ways: Both of these are outpatient procedures, which means they don't require a hospital stay.

This is called jaundice. Jaundice is very common among infants, especially in those born before 38 weeks, but it usually goes away in 2 to 3 weeks. Jaundice caused by biliary atresia lasts longer than that. Their abdomen also may swell, they'll have gray or white stools, and their pee will be dark. This happens because their liver can't process bilirubin -- a reddish-brown substance that's made when red blood cells break down. It's what gives poop its brown color. Some babies also might have frequent nosebleeds or intense itching.","Doctors believe a number of things may trigger biliary atresia, including: It isn't passed down from one family member to another, and babies can't catch it from someone else. Girls who are born prematurely are most at risk. So are Asian and African-American babies.","Many liver conditions have the same symptoms as biliary atresia. To make sure they find the right cause, your child's doctor may test their blood for high levels of bilirubin. They may also do some or all of the following:","The most common treatment is the Kasai procedure. It's done if the blocked bile ducts are outside the baby's liver. During the operation, your baby's surgeon will replace the blocked bile ducts with part of their intestine. This lets bile drain from their liver through the new ""duct"" and into their intestine.If it's done before your baby is 3 months old, the surgery has about an 80% success rate. If it's not successful, babies usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. If the blocked bile ducts are inside the liver, medication may help get rid of bile, and vitamin A, D, and E supplements may be prescribed. But a liver transplant probably will be needed."

The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. Another drug, obeticholic acid (Ocaliva), can be used with ursodiol or alone to treat PBC. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue. Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms. When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option.Primary biliary cholangitis is a disease that damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need. When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should. This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant."

They do know that biofeedback promotes relaxation, which can help relieve a number of conditions that are related to stress.During a biofeedback session, electrodes are attached to your skin. Finger sensors can also be used. These electrodes/sensors send signals to a monitor, which displays a sound, flash of light, or image that represents your heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, sweating, or muscle activity. When you're under stress, these functions change. Your heart rate speeds up, your muscles tighten, your blood pressure rises, you start to sweat, and your breathing quickens. You can see these stress responses as they happen on the monitor, and then get immediate feedback as you try to stop them. Biofeedback sessions are typically done in a therapist's office, but there are computer programs that connect the biofeedback sensor to your own computer. A biofeedback therapist helps you practice relaxation exercises, which you fine-tune to control different body functions. For example, you might use a relaxation technique to turn down the brainwaves that activate when you have a headache.

In some cases, however, a black eye is a warning sign of more serious injury to the eye or to the skull. Any damage to the eyeball that causes it to become red and swollen must be promptly evaluated by a doctor or an eye specialist. Blunt force eye injuries, as happens in fighting, competitive sports, and ordinary accidents, could involve an unsuspected detached retina, internal bleeding, or other serious problems.

The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair-like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors.

Bleeding from a Minor Head Wound,https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/head-injuries-causes-and-treatments,"There are many different types of head injuries.  Concussion. This is the most common type of head injury. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that happens when the brain is jarred or shaken hard enough to bounce against the skull. It can range from mild to severe. You don't have to be hit in the head to get a concussion. An impact elsewhere on the body can create enough force to jar the brain.  Contusion. A bruise on the actual brain itself is called a contusion. It can cause bleeding and swelling.  Intracranial hematoma (ICH). This is bleeding under the skull in the brain that forms a clot. Brain hematomas range from mild to severe and are grouped according to where they form. Skull fracture. Sometimes, a broken skull bone can affect the brain. The broken pieces of bone can cut into the brain and cause bleeding and other types of injury.","Signs and symptoms of a concussion may show up immediately, or they can take hours or even days to show up. You don’t always lose consciousness with a concussion. A concussion causes changes in a person's mental status and can disrupt the normal functioning of the brain. Multiple concussions can have a long-lasting, life-changing effect. Signs of a TBI, like a concussion, include: Confusion Depression Dizziness or balance problems Double or fuzzy vision Feeling foggy or groggy Feeling sluggish or tired Headache Memory loss Nausea Sensitivity to light or noise Sleep disturbance Trouble concentrating Trouble remembering Signs or symptoms that a head injury may be more than a concussion and requires emergency treatment include: Changes in size of pupils Clear or bloody fluid draining from the nose, mouth, or ears Convulsions Distorted facial features Facial bruising Fracture in the skull or face Impaired hearing, smell, taste, or vision Inability to move one or more limbs Irritability Lightheadedness Loss of consciousness Low breathing rate Restlessness, clumsiness, or lack of coordination Severe headache Slurred speech or blurred vision Stiff neck or vomiting Sudden worsening of symptoms after initial improvement Swelling at the site of the injury Persistent vomiting","The most important step to take is to buy and properly use protective head gear that has been approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Be sure to buy the right size for a proper fit and to wear the helmet or headgear properly. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, helmets or headgear should be worn at all times for the following activities: Baseball and softball Cycling Football Hockey Horseback riding Riding powered recreational vehicles Skateboarding and riding scooters Skiing Snowboarding WrestlingIn addition, the FDA has approved the noninvasive device, called Q-Collar which can be worn by athletes to help prevent head injuries. The C-shaped collar applies compressive force to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce movement of the brain, which may occur because of hits to the head. The device may reduce specific changes in the brain that are associated with brain injury. Other things you can do to keep yourself and your kids safer: Wear light-reflecting clothes when riding a bike at night. Don't dive in water less than 12 feet deep or any body of water where you cannot see the bottom, murky water. Make sure that children's play areas and equipment are safe and in good repair. Don't let children play sports that are inappropriate for their age. Supervise and teach children how to properly use sports equipment. Don't wear clothing that interferes with vision. Follow all rules at water parks and swimming pools. Don't skateboard or cycle on uneven or unpaved surfaces. Don't play sports when you are tired or very ill.Head injuries are damage to the scalp, skull, or brain caused by trauma. When it affects the brain, they’re called  a traumatic brain injury, or TBI.  To most people, head injuries are considered an acceptable risk when engaging in sports and other types of recreational activities. But they’re dangerous. They can lead to permanent disability, mental impairment, and even death. There are steps you can take to lower the risk and protect yourself and your children.  ",,"If you think you may have a concussion or suspect that someone else has one, the most important step to take is to prevent further injury. Stop whatever activity you are involved in and tell someone you think you may have been injured. Then get medical attention. If you're playing as part of a team, ask to be taken out of the game and tell the coach what happened. If a fellow player has signs of being confused or a sudden loss of coordination, be sure to report this to a coach. If you are coaching a team and you notice a potential injury, take the person out of the game, and see that the person gets medical care. Receiving medical attention as soon as possible is important for any type of potentially moderate to severe TBI. Undiagnosed injuries that don't receive proper care can cause long-term disability and impairment. Keep in mind that although death from a sports injury is rare, brain injuries are the leading cause of sports-related deaths.Symptoms should be closely monitored often with a moderate to severe injury. It may require an overnight stay in the hospital. A doctor may take X-rays to check for potential skull fracture and stability of the spine. In some cases the doctor may ask for a CT scan or an MRI to check on the extent of the damage that occurred. More severe injuries may need surgery to relieve pressure from swelling.  If a child sustains a head injury, don’t automatically have them X-rayed. Monitor them carefully for age appropriate symptoms of a TBI such as confusion or behavioral change. Don’t give them medications, including aspirin, without advice from your doctors. If the doctor sends you home with an injured person, they may instruct you to watch that person closely. That may involve waking the person every few hours to ask questions such as ""What's your name?"" or ""Where are you?"" to be sure the person is OK. Be sure you've asked the doctor and understand what symptoms to watch for and which ones require immediate attention. Guidelines urge doctors not allow someone who has been injured to return to activity that involves risk of further injury until completely free of symptoms. Most teens recover within two weeks, while it may take younger children up to four weeks to recover. But symptoms of severe injury could persist for months or even years. A person with a moderate to serious injury will likely require rehabilitation that may include physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, medication, psychological counseling, and social support."

Blocked Tear Ducts,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-are-blocked-tear-ducts,"Tear ducts are like tiny tunnels that your tears pass through. They’re part of the drainage system that goes from your eyes to your throat. Glands inside your eyelids and the white part of your eyes constantly release tears into your eyes. As you blink, they drain out. They exit through two small holes called puncta in the upper and lower inside corners of your eyelids, next to your nose.",,"Sometimes babies are born with blocked tear ducts. This happens because a piece of tissue that covers the duct doesn't open up at birth like it should. It will usually open on its own within a few months. Less often, tear ducts get blocked because the tear drainage system didn't form correctly in the womb. In adults, tear ducts can get blocked for lots of reasons:",,"There are different ways to open a blocked tear duct. They range from massage to procedures that remove the blockage.You need tears for a lot more than crying. They flow across the surface of your eyes to clean and moisten them, then they leave your eyes through a system of tiny drainage tubes that run along your nose. Sometimes these tubes can get narrowed or blocked, which prevents the tears from draining out of your eyes. This extra fluid can leave your eyes watery. If your eyes are watery and irritated, get them checked to find out whether it’s a blocked tear duct. If it is, your eye doctor has things they can do to open up the blockage and help your tears flow normally again. If the portion of the tear duct in the bone of the nose is blocked, it can cause a serious infection of the tear sac called dacryocystitis."

Sometimes complications show up immediately, others take some time. Fever: It’s usually not considered serious if you get a fever 1 to 6 hours after your transfusion. But if you also feel nauseated or have chest pain, it could be something more serious. See your doctor right away. Allergic reactions: It’s possible to experience an allergic reaction to the blood you receive, even if it’s the correct blood type. If this happens, you’ll likely feel itchy and develop hives. If you have an allergic reaction, it’s likely to happen during the transfusion or very shortly after. Acute immune hemolytic reaction: This complication is rare, but is a medical emergency. It happens if your body attacks the red blood cells in the blood you’ve received. This normally takes place during or right after your transfusion, and you’ll experience symptoms like fever, chills, nausea, or pain in your chest or lower back.

It’s also known as an intestinal obstruction. If your digestive system comes to a grinding halt, you can’t have a bowel movement or pass gas. You might also notice stomach pain and a swollen belly. A common type of blockage is called fecal impaction. This is when a large, hard mass of poop gets stuck in your digestive tract and can’t get pushed out the usual way. But when your bowel is blocked by something other than hard stool, doctors call it a bowel obstruction.","Signs of an intestinal blockage will depend on how severe the obstruction is. But it almost always comes with belly pain, usually around your belly button, and cramping. Other signs include: If you’ve been constipated and have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They’ll let you know what to do, including whether to call 911.

Most partial blockages get better on their own. Your doctor may give you a special diet that’s easier on your intestines. Enemas of air or fluid can help clear blockages by raising the pressure inside your bowels. A mesh tube called a stent is a safe option for people who are too sick for surgery. Your doctor puts it in your intestine to force the bowel open. Some people may not need anything more than a stent. Others may need surgery after they become stable.Surgery is usually the best treatment for a totally blocked intestine when your bowel is damaged. Your doctor can treat the cause of the obstruction or take out the blocked area and any damaged tissue. If you have surgery, you may need a colostomy or ileostomy. After your doctor takes out the damaged part of your intestine, they sew the rest to an opening in your skin. Poop exits your body through this opening and goes into a disposable bag. In some cases, your intestines can be reattached after you get better."

Scientists aren’t sure exactly what causes the other forms of Bowen’s disease. However, long-term sun exposure and aging may increase your odds of getting many skin cancers, including this one. Poisoning with arsenic also appears to make you more likely to get this early form of skin cancer. ","You can’t always tell by looking at your skin if you have Bowen’s disease. Many other skin conditions can look the same. It can be mistaken for harmless disorders -- like rashes or eczema -- as well as life-threatening ones, including melanoma. Your doctor usually has to take a sample of your skin for testing (biopsy) to confirm it.","Bowen’s disease can spread to deeper layers of your skin. Your doctor (a dermatologist, who specializes in skin care and treatment) probably will recommend something called surgical excision. They’ll gently remove the cancerous area and about a quarter-inch beyond it. If you have a larger patch, you may need a more detailed procedure called Mohs surgery. A thin layer of tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope. If cancer cells are seen in the outside edges of the tissue, another thin layer is removed and studied. When no cancer cells are found, the surgery is over. Besides surgery, other treatment options are: If you have Bowen’s disease, you’re at a higher risk for other types of skin cancers, especially if you have a weak immune system from disease or medical treatments.

This causes symptoms that affect your urine flow, such as: When your urethra is squeezed, it also means your bladder has to work harder to push urine out. Over time, the bladder muscles get weak, which makes it harder for it to empty. This can lead to: Urinary tract infections, bleeding, bladder damage, and bladder stonesIt rarely leads to other conditions, but it can, and a couple of them are serious. For example, BPH can lead to kidney damage or, worst-case, cause a problem where you can’t pee at all. A larger prostate doesn’t mean you’ll have more or worse symptoms.

During this, they put on a glove and gently insert one finger into your rectum to check the size and shape of your prostate. Basic tests: Your doctor may start with one or more of these: Advanced tests: Based on the results of those tests, your doctor may order additional tests to rule out other problems or to see more clearly what’s happening. These might include:","How your doctor handles your case varies based on your age, health, the size of your prostate, and how BPH affects you. If your symptoms don’t bother you too much, you can put off treatment and see how it goes. Lifestyle changes: You may want to start with things you can control. For example, you can: Medicine: For mild to moderate BPH, your doctor might suggest medicine. Some medications work by relaxing the muscles in your prostate and bladder. Others help shrink your prostate. For some men, it takes a mix of medicines to get the best results. Procedures: If lifestyle changes and medications don’t work, your doctor has a number of ways to remove part or all of your prostate. Many of these are called “minimally invasive,” meaning they’re easier on you than regular surgery. They use probes or scopes and don’t require large cuts in your body.Examples are TUMT,  Rezūm, and laser therapy to remove part of your prostate gland. Other surgeries include: Transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, in which the doctor uses a scope and cuts out pieces of the gland with a wire loop Transurethral incision of the prostate or TUIP, in which a few small cuts are made in the prostate to reduce the gland’s pressure on the urethra. UroLift system is a permanently placed device used to lift and hold the enlarged prostate tissue out of the way, so it no longer blocks the urethra.  In some cases, your doctor may also suggest a traditional, open surgery or a robotic procedure to remove your prostate."
Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate),https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/bradycardia,"Electrical signals travel through the heart’s four chambers -- two on the top called the atria and below them, the two ventricles. These signals prompt it to beat in a steady rhythm. But pulses don’t always fire off as they should. This creates what’s called arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats.Some conditions cause the heart to beat too fast or to flutter. With bradycardia, it’s the opposite. The electrical problem slows down the time in between heartbeats.  You may simply have a slower-than-normal heart rate that doesn’t cause any symptoms. The electrical activity may be working fine, just a little slower than it does in most people. You wouldn’t even be diagnosed with this condition. And even with bradycardia, you may never notice any symptoms or need treatment. But that’s not always the case.","The biggest concern is your heart isn’t doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity. If you check your heart rate and it’s regularly below 60 beats per minute, be aware of those symptoms. If you have no other symptoms, you probably don’t need to see a doctor right away. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are. But, bring it up at your next appointment.","The chances of getting bradycardia increase as you get older, though that’s true of most heart conditions. The causes of bradycardia can vary greatly from one person to the next. The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it:","Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it’s not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you’re having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it’s a way to measure your heart’s electrical system. If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you’ve had.","If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug.If these approaches don’t work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker. A surgeon will put this small device into your chest. It has thin, flexible wires, called leads, which extend to the heart. They carry small electrical charges that help keep the heart pumping at a steady rate. If you have been given a pacemaker, listen to your doctor’s instructions about how it operates and any signs it might not be working.Generally, it is normal to have a slower heart rate when you’re resting. It can be a sign of good health. But if it’s too slow, it could be a symptom of a condition called bradycardia. Normally, your heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute when you’re at rest. But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it’s beating slowly and if you should get treatment."
Brain Aneurysm,https://www.webmd.com/brain/brain-aneurysm,"A brain aneurysm is a weak spot in the wall of a blood vessel inside the brain that can sometimes burst and cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).Think of a weak spot in a balloon and how it feels stretched out and thin. A brain aneurysm is like that. That area of the blood vessel gets worn out from constant flow of blood and bulges out, almost like a bubble. It can grow to the size of a small berry. There are different types: Saccular aneurysms are the most common type of brain aneurysm. They bulge out in a dome shape. They’re connected to the artery by a narrow “neck.” Fusiform aneurysms aren’t as common as saccular aneurysms. They don’t pouch out in a dome shape. Instead, they make a widened spot in the blood vessel. Although brain aneurysms sound alarming, most don’t cause symptoms or health problems. You can enjoy a long life without ever realizing that you have one.But in rare cases, aneurysms can grow big, leak, or explode. Bleeding in the brain, known as a hemorrhagic stroke, is serious, and you’ll need medical care right away.","The type of symptoms you have from a brain aneurysm depend on whether it ruptures or not. Ruptured brain aneurysm symptoms You need emergency care if you suddenly get an intensely painful headache, lose consciousness, or have any of these other symptoms of an aneurysm rupture: Although brain aneurysms usually don’t show symptoms, they can press on the brain and nerves as they get bigger. Unruptured brain aneurysm symptoms See a doctor at once if you’re having a new headache or pain above or behind your eye. Call 911.  Other symptoms of an unruptured aneurysm are: A sudden and intense headache can also be a sign you have a leaking aneurysm (sentinel bleed). This can be a warning sign you’ll soon have a full rupture.",Smoking and high blood pressure are the things that put you at the most risk of having a brain aneurysm. But several other things in your medical history and lifestyle also increase your odds. Medical history Things in your medical history that can play a role include: Lifestyle,"Several types of scans and tests can be used to figure out whether you have a brain aneurysm. They include: CT scan: This exam creates images of your brain. You will lie on a table that slides into a CT scanner. A technician will inject contrast dye into one of your veins to make it easier to see the blood flow and spot aneurysms in your brain. MRI: This exam is similar in that you lie on a table that slides into a scanner. The MRI uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and blood vessels. MRIs and CT scans can detect aneurysms larger than 3 to 5 millimeters. The following tests are more invasive than CT or MRI scans. But they could give you and your doctors a more complete picture of what’s going on: Angiogram: This test, considered the most reliable way to detect aneurysms, shows the weak spots in your blood vessels. During the test, you lie on an X-ray table, and you will be given something to numb any pain. Your doctor will insert a small flexible tube through a blood vessel in the leg. They’ll guide that tube, called a catheter, into the blood vessels in your neck that reach the brain. Then they’ll inject a contrast dye into you, and X-rays will be taken that show all the blood vessels in the brain. This gives your doctor a map of your blood vessels, pinpointing the aneurysm.Cerebrospinal fluid test: Your doctor may order this test if they think an aneurysm may have ruptured. You’ll be given something to block any pain. A technician will put a needle into you to draw spinal fluid. That fluid is tested to see whether it contains blood, which could mean an aneurysm has ruptured.","Ruptured brain aneurysm treatment You need treatment as soon as possible if you have a ruptured brain aneurysm, because it’s likely that it will bleed again. Treatment involves stopping the blood flow into the aneurysm. The procedures carry risks. Your doctor will figure out which treatment works best based on your health, and the size, type, and location of the aneurysm. Surgical clipping: A section of your skull is removed to locate the aneurysm. A metal clip is placed on the opening of the aneurysm to cut off the blood flow. Your skull is then sealed shut. Endovascular coiling: This doesn’t require surgery that opens the skull. Your doctor will insert a catheter into your groin to reach the affected blood vessel where the aneurysm is located.The doctor will send tiny platinum coils through the tube and place them inside the aneurysm. The coils conform to the shape of the aneurysm, stopping the blood flow there. This may be safer than surgical clipping, but it has a higher chance of the aneurysm bleeding again. Flow diverter surgery: This option is for larger brain aneurysms in which neither clipping nor coiling would work. In this procedure, your doctor inserts a stent, usually made of metal mesh, inside the artery. It becomes a wall inside the vessel to divert blood away from the aneurysm. To help manage symptoms and prevent complications of an aneurysm, your doctor may suggest: Unruptured brain aneurysm treatment Small aneurysms that haven’t ruptured and aren’t causing symptoms may not need treatment. But this depends on your health and the aneurysm. You can talk this all over with your doctors."
Brain Tumors in Adults,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/brain-tumors-in-adults,"A brain tumor is a cluster of abnormal cells that grows out of control in your brain.

If there's reason to suspect a brain tumor, the doctor may request one or more of the following tests: The doctor may also ask for a biopsy to see if the tumor is cancer. They’ll remove a tissue sample from your brain. They might do it during surgery to remove the tumor. Or they could insert a needle through a small hole drilled into your skull. They’ll send the sample to a lab for testing.","Your doctor will consider several things in deciding how to treat your brain tumor, including:Surgery to remove the tumor is typically the first option once a brain tumor has been diagnosed. But some tumors can't be surgically removed because of their location in the brain. In those cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be options for killing and shrinking the tumor. Sometimes you’ll get chemotherapy or radiation after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Your doctor may treat tumors that are deep in the brain or in areas that are difficult to reach with gamma knife therapy, a form of highly focused radiation therapy. Because treatment for cancer can damage healthy tissue, you should talk about possible long-term effects of whatever treatment is being used with your doctor.

These conditions cause your body’s natural defense system to attack itself. If you have pemphigus, your immune system tries to destroy your skin and mucous membranes -- the moist parts of your body. That can cause large blisters in your mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. Pemphigus isn’t contagious. Luckily, it can be treated with medications.","Some skin diseases can look like pemphigus. Bullous pemphigoid, for example, causes large, fluid-filled blisters, but they generally don’t burst as easily. And unlike pemphigus, it usually affects people over age 60. Herpes is another condition that can cause painful blisters on your mouth and genitals. But it’s not caused by your body attacking itself. If you have itchy or painful blisters anywhere on your body, don’t try to figure out what’s wrong. See your doctor. Only they can tell you for sure whether you have pemphigus or something else.","Pemphigus is an autoimmune disorder. This means that your immune system attacks your body’s cells -- in this case, the skin cells. In rare cases, certain drugs can trigger the condition. This includes penicillin and some rheumatoid arthritis medications. But most of the time, we don’t know what causes it. It isn’t contagious.","It can be tricky. That’s because a number of conditions can cause blisters. To make sure they find the right cause, your doctor will likely order a number of tests, including: Medical history. Your doctor will ask you what medications you take, as some drugs can cause this condition.  A skin exam. Your doctor will use their finger or a cotton swab to rub a patch of your skin that’s not covered by a blister. If it peels easily, you could have pemphigus.Skin biopsy. Your doctor will take a piece of tissue from one of your blisters and look at it under a microscope. Blood tests. Your doctor will check your blood for specific antibodies called desmogleins. Antibodies are proteins your body makes to find bad germs and kill them before they harm you. If you have pemphigus, you’ll have more of these antibodies in your blood than normal. As your symptoms improve, the number of these antibodies in your blood goes down. Endoscopy. If you have blisters in your mouth, your doctor may use a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope to look down your throat.","Your doctor will likely give you medicine that’ll help ease your symptoms and make you more comfortable. What they prescribe will depend on what type of pemphigus you have and how bad your symptoms are. Treatment might include: Corticosteroids. These are usually the first line of treatment and can be very effective to relieve symptoms, often within a couple of weeks. They are typically given in pill form. Immunosuppressants. These drugs keep your immune system from attacking healthy tissues. Biological therapies. If other medications aren’t working, your doctor may give you a medication called rituximab (Rituxan). You'll get it in an injection. It helps decrease the number of antibodies that are attacking your body. Antibiotics, antivirals, and antifungal medications. These fight or prevent infections. If pemphigus isn’t treated, it could be life-threatening. Sometimes, you may have to be admitted to the hospital until you get better. Wound care. Topical antibiotics and wound dressings are used to heal the blisters. Plasmapheresis.  If the pemphigus doesn’t respond to the other treatments, your doctor can use a special machine to take the plasma from your blood. They then replace it with plasma from a blood donor."
Brazilian Trypanosomiasis,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/chagas-disease-overview,"T. cruzi isn’t passed from person to person like a cold or flu. Instead, the parasite is spread by triatomine bugs, also known as “kissing bugs.” They’re called that because they often bite people on the thin skin around the eyes or mouth, usually while the person is asleep. (The bites are fairly painless and probably wouldn’t wake someone up.) But the bug’s bite isn’t what causes the infection -- it’s their poop. If a bug bites an infected animal or person, it becomes a carrier of T. cruzi, which is passed through its feces. The next time the bug feeds on a person, it leaves droppings on them, which can enter that person’s body through their eyes, nose, mouth, or the wound from the bite itself.Although people mainly get infected from triatomine bugs, the parasite can be passed a few other ways: In November 2014, a study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that bed bugs can carry T. cruzi. It’s not clear whether these bugs are likely to pass the parasite to people, though.","Chagas disease has two phases. During the first (or acute) phase, symptoms are usually mild. They might include: These early symptoms -- if they happen at all -- usually fade on their own in a few weeks or months. The only people in real danger are young children or people with already weakened immune systems.While the symptoms may go away, the parasite remains in the body. It can stay dormant for years or even decades. If the disease enters its second (or chronic) phase, it can cause serious heart and intestinal problems, including:",,,"Chagas disease is easiest to treat during the first phase. But the lack of symptoms can make it tough to spot early on. If you think you have it, your doctor can give you blood tests. If the tests show you're infected, you’ll need an EKG test to check for any heart problems. Two drugs can treat the disease: benznidazole (Alunbrig) and nifurtimox (Lampit), which kill the parasite. They work well if taken soon after infection. The longer someone's had Chagas disease, the less likely the drugs are to work. Pregnant women can’t take them, but infected newborns can. If you’re in the U.S., the only way to get the drugs is through the CDC, since they’re not approved by the FDA. The drugs must be taken for up to 2 months. They can cause serious side effects, especially in older people."
Breast Cancer and Pregnancy,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-during-pregnancy,"The best thing you can do while pregnant is to see your doctor regularly. These visits are called prenatal (or ""before birth"") checkups, and they're crucial for keeping you and your baby in the best possible health. During some of these visits, you may have breast exams to check for changes.   A mammogram is considered fairly safe during pregnancy, but it may not be as helpful because of the increased density of the breasts. A three-dimensional mammogram may be a better option.  If a suspicious lump is found, your doctor should do a biopsy. They'll remove a small sample of the suspicious tissue with a needle or by making a small cut. The sample tissue gets checked under a microscope and with other methods to look for any cancer cells.   Your doctor might also give you an ultrasound to assess the extent of any disease and to guide the biopsy.",,,,
Breast Cancer and Your Genes,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/genetic-testing-risk,"If your genetic testing shows you have a mutation linked to cancer, there are still several steps you can take to lower your chances for developing breast cancer. If you have an increased risk, you can also consider counseling to help navigate the emotions surrounding the test results, and speaking with a health care professional about next steps.",,"Women who inherit the mutated BRCA1 gene have a 55% to 65% risk of breast cancer by age 70. Women with mutated BRCA2 have about a 45% risk. Men with a BRCA mutation are also at a higher risk of breast cancer. Transgender and gender expansive people (those who don’t identify as strictly male or female) can also inherit these gene mutations. If you’re part of this community, you should consider that top surgery, which removes breast tissue, doesn’t completely remove this risk. Either mutation brings a higher risk of getting breast cancer at a younger age (before menopause). People who have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a higher risk of a second primary breast cancer, too. Bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts) is also more common in women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.These mutations also raise your risk of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Men face a higher risk of prostate cancer.    ","Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of getting breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a chance of not getting breast cancer. Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $400 to more than $3,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance coverage varies. The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done. Legislation has been enacted to protect people who may have a documented genetic risk of cancer from employment or insurance problems. The best thing you can do is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel people who have a genetic risk for cancer. But for some people, genetic testing may help you make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while easing the anxiety of not knowing your genetic background. You can also make a decision regarding prevention, with both medications and prophylactic surgery. In addition, many people take part in medical research that, in the long run, may lower their risk of death from breast cancer.",
Breast Cancer in Men,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-men,It's rare for a man under age 35 to get breast cancer. Your chance of getting breast cancer goes up with age. Most breast cancers in men happen between ages 60 and 70.Other things that raise the odds for male breast cancer include:  ,"Symptoms of breast cancer in men are similar to those in women. Most male breast cancers are diagnosed when a man finds a lump on his chest. But men tend to delay going to the doctor until they have more severe symptoms, like bleeding from the nipple. By that point, the cancer may have spread.",,"The same techniques that are used to diagnose breast cancer in women are used in men: physical exams, mammography, and biopsies (looking at small samples of tissue under a microscope).Treatments for men and women are generally the same. Many men benefit from a combination of treatments, such as: Remember, like anyone who has breast cancer or who has recovered from it, you'll need to have checkups with your doctor for the rest of your life. Getting regular medical care is key to staying healthy.Even though men don't have breasts like women’s, they have a small amount of breast tissue. The ""breasts"" of a man are similar to the breasts of a girl before puberty. Girls’ tissue grows and develops, but men’s doesn't. But because they still have breast tissue, men can get breast cancer. Men get the same types of breast cancers that women do, but cancers involving the parts that make and store milk are rare. The risk of a man getting breast cancer in his lifetime is about 1 per 1,000. Doctors used to think that breast cancer in men was more severe than it was in women, but it now seems that it's about the same. The major problem is that breast cancer in men is often diagnosed later than breast cancer in women. This may be because men are less likely to be suspicious of something strange in that area.","The same techniques that are used to diagnose breast cancer in women are used in men: physical exams, mammography, and biopsies (looking at small samples of tissue under a microscope).Treatments for men and women are generally the same.

Breast Cancer Risk Factors,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/overview-risks-breast-cancer,"A risk factor is anything that increases a person's chance of getting a disease. Different cancers have different risk factors. However, having a cancer risk factor, or even several of them, does not necessarily mean that a person will get cancer. Some women with one or more breast cancer risk factors never develop breast cancer, while about half of women with breast cancer have no apparent risk factors. Significantly higher risk Moderately higher risk Slightly higher risk Previous abnormal breast biopsy.

"Breast Cancer, Metastatic or Recurrent",https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/metastatic-breast-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis,"You might get blood tests done, but these can’t show for sure that cancer has spread. You’ll need to get imaging tests to see if the cancer has spread, and, if so, how far and to what parts of your body. Some of the tests that you may get include: PET scan: You’ll get a radioactive sugar injected into your blood. Cancer cells will quickly use it up. A scan then shows all the places in your body where the sugar was concetrated and metabolized. These areas could be cancer. Bone scan: A radioactive tracer put into your blood collects in changed areas of bone that might be cancer. These “hot spots” can then be seen on a whole-body scan.CT scan: Special X-rays show detailed 3-D pictures of your insides. Sometimes, doctors use a dye to get clearer pictures. You may get this test done at the same time as a PET scan (called a PET-CT).",,,"It takes time to schedule and get your imaging tests, and then more time to get a biopsy. Your imaging test results might be ready in a day or two. Biopsy results can take up to a week. Your doctor can give you an idea of how long it will take. Ask how you’ll get the results -- A phone call? An office visit? If you don’t hear from your doctor within a week, call the office. It can be hard to wait. If you’re concerned that the cancer could get worse during that time, keep in mind that in most cases, the relatively short wait (though it feels long to you) won’t make a difference to the cancer. If you have questions or are worried, tell your doctor. The answers may help you better understand your situation and the help you can get.If your breast cancer spreads to other parts of your body, doctors will call it “metastatic.” (""Metastasize"" means to spread.)

Breast Cancer: Screening,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-screening-detection-overview,"The sooner breast cancer gets diagnosed, the better your odds of getting successful treatment. That's why it’s important to get mammograms as recommended, to be familiar with how your breasts usually look, and to report any changes to your doctor ASAP. Why?  ",,,,
Breast Cancer: Treatment,https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-treatment,"Some treatments remove or destroy the disease within the breast and nearby tissues, such as lymph nodes. These include: Surgery. For most people, the first step is to take out the tumor. An operation called lumpectomy removes only the part of your breast that has cancer. It’s sometimes called breast-conserving surgery. In a mastectomy, doctors remove the whole breast. There are different types of mastectomies and lumpectomies. Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-energy waves to kill cancer cells. Most women under age 70 who have a lumpectomy get radiation, too. Doctors also might recommend this method if the disease has spread. It helps destroy any cancer cells that the surgeon couldn’t remove. Radiation can come from a machine outside your body, or you might have tiny seeds that give off radiation placed inside your breast where the tumor was. Other treatments destroy or control cancer cells all over your body: Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. You take the medicines as pills or through an IV. Most people get it after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Doctors also prescribe it before surgery to make tumors smaller. Chemo works well against cancer, but it also can harm healthy cells.Hormone therapy uses drugs to prevent hormones, especially estrogen, from fueling the growth of breast cancer cells. Medicines include tamoxifen (Nolvadex) for women before and after menopause and aromatase inhibitors including anastrozole (Arimidex), exemestane (Aromasin), and letrozole (Femara) for postmenopausal women. Some types of this therapy work by stopping the ovaries from making hormones, either through surgery or medication. Fulvestrant (Faslodex) is an injection that keeps estrogen from attaching to cancer cells. Targeted therapy such as fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki (Enhertu), lapatinib (Tykerb), pertuzumab (Perjeta), and trastuzumab (Herceptin) trigger your body’s immune system to help destroy cancer cells. These medicines target breast cancer cells that have high levels of a protein called HER2. T-DM1, or ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), is a medicine that combines Herceptin and the chemotherapy medicine emtansine to target HER2-positive cancer cells. Abemaciclib (Verzenio), palbociclib (Ibrance), and ribociclib (Kisqali) are often used with an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant (Faslodex), in women with certain types of advanced cancer. Abemaciclib (Verzenio) can be used alone in women who have already been treated with hormone therapy and chemotherapy. Alpelisib (Piqray) is a PI3K inhibitor that treats breast cancer in men and women who have a certain gene change resulting from treatment with hormonal therapy. Neratinib (Nerlynx) also works against HER2-positive breast cancer by blocking the cancer cells from getting growth signals. A new class of drugs called PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitors targets an enzyme that feeds cancer cells. PARP inhibitors include olaparib (Lynparza) and talazoparib (Talzenna).",,,,"Both breast cancer and the treatment you get for it cause symptoms and side effects. Even if the main goal of your treatment is a cure, palliative care that eases discomfort and emotional distress is an important part of your treatment. You can have palliative care while you continue to have therapy focused on curing the disease. The type of palliative care you get depends on several things: Talk to your doctor about palliative care at the start of your treatment. They’ll help you find the type that fits your needs as your treatment goes on. Your options may include medications, chemo or radiation to shrink tumors and ease pain, changes to your diet, mental health care, stress reduction, and more."
Breast Development in Boys,https://www.webmd.com/men/what-is-gynecomastia,"Gynecomastia is a condition that makes breast tissue swell in boys and men. It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called ""pseudogynecomastia."" Although breasts don't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue. Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone, which guides their sexual growth during puberty. But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls. When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes. Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree.","Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore. This might make you worry that you have breast cancer, which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer, but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out. Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness. See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts.","A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known. In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are:Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies. Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as: Anti-androgens. These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. Anabolic steroids and androgens. Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions. HIV drugs. Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called ""highly active antiretroviral therapy."" Anti-anxiety drugs. Medicines such as diazepam (Valium) can sometimes cause gynecomastia. Heart medications. Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes. Medicines used to empty your stomach. For example, metoclopramide (Reglan) can have gynecomastia as a side effect. Ulcer drugs. Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB). Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments.","If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer. They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include: You might also be given tests. They could include:","Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment. When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist, who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body. How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs. If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition. You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth. In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as:"
Breast Engorgement,https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-engorgement,"Breast engorgement means that your breasts are filled with too much milk. It can make them feel swollen, warm, and tender. It’s normal before you start breastfeeding and can mild or more intense. After you deliver a baby, your body is still hard at work. Two of its new missions: helping you heal and getting food to your newborn. In the hours and days following labor, circulation to your breasts increases. At first, they produce a thick, yellowish fluid called colostrum. It's full of protein and everything your baby needs to build a strong digestive system and stay healthy. Three to 4 days after labor, your body makes milk all the time and stores it in your breast tissue. The first time your milk comes in, your breasts can become engorged, or filled with too much milk.","If your breasts are engorged, they may feel: You may also have lumps or flattened nipples.","Your breasts may naturally become engorged soon after you give birth as your milk comes in. It can also happen if you aren’t able to breastfeed or pump often enough.  Breastfeeding has many benefits for mother and baby alike. But it isn’t always easy.

If you're breastfeeding, this can make it tough for your baby to latch on or create a painful and improper latch. Pump or manually express milk first, then try again.You can also try to reduce the hardness in your breasts by massaging them, taking a warm shower, or applying a warm compress to your breasts before feeding. If that doesn't work, don't keep trying. The warmth may increase the swelling instead and prevent the milk from flowing. Once you get some milk out, the engorgement should go away. Then your baby will be able to latch and transfer the rest of the milk, emptying the breast. Once your body understands how much milk your baby needs and gets into a rhythm, engorgement shouldn't be an issue. If you still feel that tightness and pain, try these tips and talk to your doctor. If you have fever, discharge from the nipple, or body aches, you should also talk with your doctor. You could also check in with a lactation consultant. You can also do these:"
Breast Infection (Mastitis),https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-mastitis,"Mastitis is a common condition in women who breastfeed. As many as 1 in 10 breastfeeding women in the U.S. get it. It's caused by a backup of milk in the milk ducts. This happens when your baby isn't sucking or attaching properly, or favors one breast over the other. Mastitis can also happen if you don't feed or pump regularly. Breastfeeding women aren't the only ones who get mastitis. If you're not breastfeeding, a cracked nipple or nipple piercing can cause the breast infection. Both allow bacteria to get into the milk ducts. This is especially common in women who smoke.","Just like any other infection, the tissue around the infected area becomes inflamed to keep it from spreading to other parts of the body. With mastitis, the infected milk duct causes the breast to swell. Your breast may look red and feel tender or warm. Many women with mastitis feel like they have the flu, including achiness, chills, and a fever of 101 F or higher.

The fever and chills give it away, as does a red, wedge-shaped area on the breast that points toward the nipple. There are two things to rule out: a breast abscess, which happens when mastitis isn't treated quickly, and inflammatory breast cancer, which is rare and shares the symptoms of redness and swelling.","Whether or not you're breastfeeding, antibiotics should have you feeling better in a day or two. Take them as directed. If you are breastfeeding, continue drinking lots of water, wearing loose bras, and resting as much as you can. Your doctor may suggest ibuprofen, or something like it, to take care of the fever and pain. It's important to keep breastfeeding and move that milk in and out of the ducts. Continue expressing milk if it is too painful to feed from the breast. "
Breast Lumps (Benign),https://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/benign-breast-lumps,"Fibroadenomas. These are the most common benign lumps. If you push on them, they are solid, round, rubbery lumps that move freely. They’re usually painless. Women between 20 and 30 get them most often. They’re also more common in African-American women. Fibroadenomas can be surgically removed. Fibrocystic changes. Changes in hormones during your menstrual cycles can create changes in your breasts. These are known as fibrocystic breast changes. You could get lumps in both breasts that increase in size and tenderness just before your period. You might have nipple discharge as well.The lumps are milk ducts and tissues around them that have grown and widened to form cysts. These  enlarge quickly in response to hormones released near your period. The lumps may be hard or rubbery and could feel like a single (large or small) lump.

Breast Problems,https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-breast-problems-basic-information,"Breast lumps come in many forms, including cysts, adenomas, and papillomas. They differ in size, shape, and location, as well as in causes and treatment. About half of all women have lumpy breasts, or fibrocystic change. They are more common during the premenstrual period and usually disappear after menopause. Most lumps are benign and do not signal cancer; however, any time you find a new or unusual lump, have your doctor check it to make sure it is not precancerous or cancerous.   Researchers are studying the incidence of breast lumps in women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). In combination HRT, women take the hormones estrogen and progestin to ease the symptoms of menopause. In 2002, a study called the Women’s Health Initiative discovered that HRT often resulted in more harm than good. Taking both hormones was shown to increase the risk of breast cancer and change the breast's structure, increasing breast density and making mammograms harder to read. This could make finding cancer more difficult. To put this into numbers, if 10,000 women took combined HRT for a year, this would add up to about 8 more cases of breast cancer per year than if they had not taken hormone therapy (HT).  Cysts, which can be large or small, are often harmless, fluid-filled sacs that may be painful.   After menopause, many cysts shrink or disappear. You should immediately have your doctor check any lumps that form after menopause.   Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in women under 25 and occasionally in adolescents. These tumors are usually round, several centimeters across, and mobile. They tend to regress after menopause. Your doctor may recommend removal if the lump persists, gets larger, or if you are anxious about it. Tests will be done to check for cancer when it is removed.   Nipple adenomas are tumors of the nipple area. They vary in appearance, sometimes come back after being removed, and are sometimes associated with cancer. An intraductal papilloma is an uncommon small growth in the lining of the milk ducts near the nipple. Usually seen in women over 40, papillomas produce a discharge, which may be bloody.",,,,

Breech Position and Breech Birth,https://www.webmd.com/baby/understanding-labor-delivery-complications-basics,"A pregnancy that has gone smoothly can still have problems when it's time to deliver the baby. Your doctor and hospital are prepared to handle them. Here are some of the most common concerns: Preterm labor and premature delivery One of the greatest dangers babies face is being born too early, before their body is mature enough to survive outside the womb. The lungs, for example, may not be able to breathe air, or the baby's body may not generate enough heat to keep warm. A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Having labor contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy is called preterm labor. Also, a baby born before 37 weeks is considered a premature baby who is at risk of complications of prematurity, such as immature lungs, respiratory distress, and digestive problems. Drugs and other treatments can be used to stop preterm labor. If these treatments fail, intensive care can keep many premature babies alive. The symptoms of preterm labor and birth include:Call you doctor if you notice or feel any of those symptoms. Protracted labor Protracted labor refers to cervical dilation that is abnormally slow or to abnormally slow fetal descent. This means the labor does not progress as fast as it should. This could happen with a big baby, a baby in a breech position (buttocks down), or other abnormal presentation, or with a uterus that does not contract strongly enough. Often, there is no specific cause for protracted labor. Both the mother and the baby are at risk for several complications, including infections, if the amniotic sac has been ruptured for a long time and the birth doesn't follow.",,,,

Buerger's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-buergers-disease,"Buerger’s disease is a rare illness that inflames and blocks blood vessels in your arms and legs. This stops blood flow and leads to clots that affect your hands and feet. Doctors also call it thromboangiitis obliterans, or TAO. There’s no cure for Buerger’s disease. Almost everyone who gets it uses tobacco, including cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and snuff. Quitting can make the symptoms improve or go away completely. If you don’t quit, you might have severe tissue damage. You could even lose your fingers, toes, or parts of your limbs.","Usually, the first sign of Buerger’s disease is pain in your hands or feet that spreads to your arms and legs. It may be severe. You can get it when you’re active (called claudication) or resting. It can be worse when you’re cold or stressed. You might also notice changes in your hands and feet. They may: Your fingers and toes might: You could also have swelling along a vein just under your skin. This is usually a sign of a blood clot.

Some experts think that certain chemicals in tobacco might irritate your blood vessels, and that’s what makes them swell. Others think tobacco triggers your immune system to attack your blood vessels like they’re bad germs.","No single test can check for Buerger’s disease. Your doctor will start by asking about your tobacco use and your symptoms. They may do tests to check your blood flow and rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. For example, peripheral artery disease also causes pain in your legs, but it’s caused by plaque building up in your arteries, not inflammation. You may also have:  ","Quitting tobacco is the only way to limit the effects of Buerger’s disease. Even a few cigarettes a day can make it worse. Other treatments may help boost blood flow and ease pain, including: Your doctor might need to cut off part or all of an area with infection or gangrene (amputation). Researchers are also studying other treatments. Proteins called growth factors might speed healing and ease pain. Injections of stem cells, which can grow into other kinds of cells, may help your body make new blood vessels."

The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun.

But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.

For adolescent boys, teasing is a “rite of passage” and an important part of friendship, says David Dupper, PhD, professor of social work at the University of Tennessee. Teasing can get rough, but it’s not meant to hurt the other person, he says. “On the other hand, a bully fully intends to harm his or her victim and has the power and the means to do so.” This person might be more popular or physically stronger, and the victim may have a hard time defending themselves, Dupper says.

The yellowing occurs because the disease causes liver damage, hepatitis. For some people, yellow fever has no initial symptoms, while for others, the first symptoms appear from three to six days after exposure to the virus from a mosquito bite.

Campylobacteriosis,https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/what-is-campylobacter-infection,"Campylobacteriosis is an infection caused by bacteria you can get from contaminated food and water. It causes diarrhea. You might also hear it called campylobacter, campylobacter infection, or campylobacteriosis gastroenteritis. When people worry about eating undercooked chicken, they usually focus on getting sick from salmonella bacteria. But another common type of bacteria called campylobacter can also make you ill if you eat poultry that isn’t fully cooked. Like a salmonella infection, campylobacteriosis can cause diarrhea and sometimes other serious complications. Infants and children have a greater chance than adults for campylobacter infection, but it can strike anyone at any age. Men are also more likely than women to get infected. It’s more common in summer than winter. About 1.3 million people are infected in the United States every year. That doesn’t include the many people who never report their symptoms or get officially diagnosed.","The infection usually lasts about a week. If you’ve been infected, symptoms start within a couple of days of eating the infected food. They may include:  Some people never have symptoms. ","Campylobacter bacteria can get into your system if you eat undercooked poultry or food that has touched raw or undercooked poultry.The bacteria usually live in the digestive systems of animals, including poultry and cattle. You can also find campylobacter bacteria in unpasteurized milk","Diarrhea and vomiting are common campylobacteriosis symptoms, but they can be signs of many illnesses. This is true for bloody stools, too. To make a diagnosis, your doctor may ask for a stool sample, which they’ll send to a lab. Your doctor’s office will give you a special container in which to collect the sample. It can take several days to get the results. In rare cases, a doctor may order a blood test, but these results take even longer -- up to 2 weeks.","Most people get over the infection without medicine or special treatments. Drink lots of fluids while you have diarrhea. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, don’t take anything to prevent vomiting and diarrhea. That’s your body’s way of getting rid of the infection. Campylobacteriosis medications If your immune system is weak, your doctor might prescribe medicine to fight the infection: Antibiotic resistance and campylobacteriosis You might hear the term antibiotic resistance when people talk about campylobacter. Infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria (that means they no longer respond to some of the drugs used to treat them) can be harder to treat, can last longer, and can cause more severe illness."
Canavan Disease,https://www.webmd.com/brain/leukodystrophy-types,"The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.","The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath.

Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy.","Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including:  ","There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy.Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine."

This blocks tubes and ducts throughout your body. Over time, this thick mucus builds up inside your airways. This makes it hard to breathe. The mucus traps germs and leads to infections. It can also cause severe lung damage like cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and fibrosis (scar tissue). That’s how CF got its name. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. live with cystic fibrosis. Doctors diagnose about 1,000 new cases each year.",People with CF can have symptoms including:,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a change, or mutation, in a gene called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This gene controls the flow of salt and fluids in and out of your cells. If the CFTR gene doesn’t work the way it should, a sticky mucus builds up in your body. To get CF, you have to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from both of your parents. Ninety percent of those with affected have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. If you inherit only one copy, you won’t have any symptoms, but you will be a carrier of the disease. That means there’s a chance you could pass it to your children.

Chagas Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/chagas-disease-overview,"T. cruzi isn’t passed from person to person like a cold or flu. Instead, the parasite is spread by triatomine bugs, also known as “kissing bugs.” They’re called that because they often bite people on the thin skin around the eyes or mouth, usually while the person is asleep. (The bites are fairly painless and probably wouldn’t wake someone up.) But the bug’s bite isn’t what causes the infection -- it’s their poop. If a bug bites an infected animal or person, it becomes a carrier of T. cruzi, which is passed through its feces. The next time the bug feeds on a person, it leaves droppings on them, which can enter that person’s body through their eyes, nose, mouth, or the wound from the bite itself.Although people mainly get infected from triatomine bugs, the parasite can be passed a few other ways: In November 2014, a study from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found that bed bugs can carry T. cruzi. It’s not clear whether these bugs are likely to pass the parasite to people, though.","Chagas disease has two phases. During the first (or acute) phase, symptoms are usually mild. They might include: These early symptoms -- if they happen at all -- usually fade on their own in a few weeks or months. The only people in real danger are young children or people with already weakened immune systems.While the symptoms may go away, the parasite remains in the body.

Other signs of ichthyosis are: Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema, a red, itchy rash.","Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it’s passed down to you from your parents. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations to a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body sheds or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in early childhood. If both of your parents have the gene, you’re likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has the gene.

The use of chelation therapy to treat this condition is based on the idea that autism is caused by mercury in childhood vaccines. Studies have proven this idea to be false. But some health care providers also believe that removing metals from the body can improve autism symptoms. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says there’s no evidence that chelation is an effective treatment for autism, and it may be dangerous.

If your child has a severe form, you’ll work with a number of specialists, from physical therapists to nutritionists, and a lot of that care may happen at a hospital. In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height.

Childhood Muscular Dystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan.

Chinese Medicine,https://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine,"Western medicine tends to view the body a lot like a car. It has different systems that need the right inputs and outputs. It’s very concrete and logical. TCM, on the other hand, doesn’t focus on science and medicine. Instead, it’s based on balance, harmony, and energy. There are two central ideas behind TCM:Qi: This is also called life energy or vital energy. The belief is that it runs throughout your body. It’s always on the move and constantly changes. TCM treatments often focus on ways to promote and maintain the flow of qi. Yin and Yang: These are opposites that describe the qualities of qi. The belief is that everything in life has a little bit of its opposite, too, and balance is the key. For example, a drug from your doctor might heal disease. But it’s dangerous if you take too much of it. According to TCM, these ideas play out in our bodies. When you balance the yin and yang of Qi, you feel healthy and well. If they’re out of whack, you feel sick. TCM aims to create harmony and a healthy flow of qi.",,,,
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/chronic-lymphocytic-leukemia-rare,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte."" Lymphocytes help your body fight infection. They're made in the soft center of your bones, called the marrow. If you have CLL, your body makes an abnormally high number of lymphocytes that aren't working right. More adults get CLL than any other type of leukemia. It usually grows slowly, so you may not have symptoms for years. Some people never need treatment, but if you do, it can slow the disease and ease symptoms. People who get medical care live longer today because doctors are diagnosing CLL earlier. It's natural to have worries and questions about any serious condition. You don't have to face things alone. Tell your friends and family about any concerns you have. Let them know how they can help. And talk to your doctor about how to join a support group. It can help to speak to people who understand what you're going through.","You may have no symptoms for a while. Over time, you may have:","In most cases, doctors don't know what causes CLL. You're more likely to get it if: If you were exposed to Agent Orange, an herbicide widely used during the Vietnam War, your chances of getting CLL may also be higher.","If you have one or more swollen lymph nodes, your doctor may ask:Your doctor will give you a blood test if they think you may have CLL. The results show how many lymphocytes, platelets, and red and white cells are in your blood. If your white blood cell counts are high, you will get a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy: Your doctor will do both procedures during the same visit. By checking the samples under a microscope for abnormal cells, your doctor can tell if CLL is in your body and how fast it's moving. They can also learn more about the genetic changes in the cells. This information may help you and your doctor plan your treatment.","Some types of CLL grow very slowly. If yours is in the early stages or it’s not causing any problems, you probably don't need treatment. Studies show that it doesn't help. Even so, you should keep up with all your doctor visits. Your doctor will closely check to make sure your condition hasn't changed. You may start treatment if your doctor notices a change, like the number of lymphocytes in your blood goes up quickly, there’s a drop in the number of your red blood cells, or a lymph node is getting bigger. Your treatment may include: Chemotherapy (chemo). These are drugs that kill or control cancer cells. Doctors often combine two or more drugs that work in different ways. You may get chemo by pill, shot, or IV. The drugs travel through your blood to reach and affect cells that are dividing too quickly all over your body. This includes certain healthy cells, as well as cancer cells.People usually get chemo in 3- to 4-week cycles that include a time of treatment and a time without treatment. This rest time gives your healthy cells time to rebuild and heal. Side effects can include mouth sores, nausea, and low blood counts. But you can recover from that. Almost all side effects go away over time after treatment ends. And most chemo side effects can be treated or even prevented. Immunotherapy. These drugs help your body’s immune system recognize and destroy cancer cells. A type of immunotherapy called monoclonal antibodies is often used to treat CLL. They attach to certain proteins found on cancer cells and stimulate the immune system to destroy these cells. You get them through an IV or as a shot. Your doctor may give you this treatment on its own, but most people get it along with chemo. Immunotherapy drugs cause different side effects than chemo does. Headache, fever, rash, and blood pressure changes are just a few examples. Some can be prevented, and all can be treated."
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/cml-need-to-know-first,Most people will never know what caused them to get CML. You don't typically get it from your parents or from infections. Your smoking habits and diet don't seem to raise your chance of getting it either. The only known risk is if you've been in contact with high levels of radiation.,"CML has three phases: chronic, accelerated, and blastic. Your symptoms depend on which one you're in. Chronic phase. It's the earliest stage and the easiest to treat. You might not even have symptoms. Accelerated phase. During this period, the number of blood cells that don't work right increases. You're more likely to get some of these symptoms: Other symptoms may include stroke, changes in your vision, ringing in your ears, you feel like you're in a daze, and you get prolonged erections. Blastic phase. The leukemia cells multiply and crowd out healthy blood cells and platelets. In this stage, you'll have more severe symptoms, including:",Most people will never know what caused them to get CML. You don't typically get it from your parents or from infections. Your smoking habits and diet don't seem to raise your chance of getting it either. The only known risk is if you've been in contact with high levels of radiation.,"If you have symptoms, your doctor will want to know: Your doctor may do more tests to confirm the diagnosis, such as: Complete blood count. It's a blood test that checks to see how many white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets you have. Bone marrow test. It helps you figure out how advanced your cancer is. Your doctor uses a needle to take a sample, usually from your hip bone. FISH test (fluorescence in situ hybridization). It's a detailed lab test of your genes. Ultrasound or CT scans. They can check the size of your spleen. Ultrasounds use sound waves to make images that doctors and other medical professionals can read. A CT is an X-ray that takes a series of pictures inside your body. Polymerase chain reaction test. It's a lab test that looks for the BCR-ABL gene, which is involved in the process that tells your body to make too many of the wrong kind of white blood cells.","The goal of your treatment is to destroy the leukemia blood cells in your body and restore healthy ones to a normal level. It's usually not possible to get rid of all the bad cells. If you get treatment during the early, chronic phase of CML, it can help prevent the disease from moving to a more serious level. Doctors usually give drugs known as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) first. They slow down the rate at which your body makes leukemia cells. Some TKIs that are commonly used include: You may get bosutinib (Bosulif) and ponatinib (Iclusig) if other drugs don't help or make you too sick.If your disease continues to get worse after you've used two or more TKIs, your doctor may suggest either asciminib (Scemblix) or omacetaxine mepesuccinate (Synribo). Other CML treatment options include chemotherapy and biologic therapy, which uses a medication called interferon to help stir up action in your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. A stem cell transplant might cure some patients. It's a complicated procedure that's usually done only when your other treatments aren't working. Stem cells are in the news a lot, but usually when you hear about them they're referring to ""embryo"" stem cells that are used in cloning. The stem cells in a stem cell transplant are different. These are cells that live in your bone marrow and help make new blood cells. When you get a stem cell transplant, a donor will supply the new stem cells. You'll need to get on a waiting list to find a donor who is the right match you so that your body doesn't ""reject"" them. Close relatives, such as your brother or sister, are the best chances for a good match. If that doesn't work out, you need to get on a list of potential donors from strangers. Sometimes the best odds for the right stem cells for you will be from someone who is in the same racial or ethnic group as you."
Classic Galactosemia,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-galactrosemia,"Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it. If your baby has this condition, it means the genes that produce the enzymes to break down galactose into glucose (a sugar) are missing key parts. Without these parts, the genes can’t tell the enzymes to do their job. This causes galactose to build up in the blood, creating problems, especially for newborns.There are three main types of galactosemia: Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common. As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia. If you’re a carrier, it doesn’t mean you have to avoid galactose. But it means you can pass galactosemia along to your children.","If your newborn has classic galactosemia, they’ll appear normal at birth. Symptoms start to show up within a few days after they begin to drink breast milk or formula with lactose -- the milk sugar that contains galactose. Your baby first loses their appetite and starts vomiting. Then they get jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and the whites of their eyes. Diarrhea is common, too. The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive. Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections. They may have liver damage and kidney problems. Their brain may not mature well. That can cause developmental disabilities. Some children have issues with their motor skills and muscles.

To make sure it’s Pfeiffer and not something else, your doctor may also order:","Your child's treatment depends on the signs and symptoms. You might need a team of specialists that includes doctors, surgeons, psychologists, speech and language therapists, and more. Surgery tends to play a key role in treatment. Skull surgery: Most children have the first surgery to reshape their skull before they’re 18 months old. For children under 3 months, this can be done with very small openings in the head. For older children, doctors use traditional surgery. Typically, children will need two to four skull surgeries over the course of their lives. Midface surgery: Some children may need it to correct problems in their jaw and bring their midface bones forward. Children are usually at least 6 before this surgery is done. Treatment for breathing problems: Some children have blockages that make it hard for them to breathe. This leads to problems such as sleep apnea. To correct these problems, your doctor may suggest these:For severe cases, doctors may do a surgery called a tracheostomy. The doctor creates an opening in the child’s neck directly to the windpipe to allow for easier breathing. It’s done for children too young to have other surgeries to correct breathing problems. Other treatments: Your child may also need:Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare birth defect that affects the shape of a baby’s skull and face. When you’re born, the top of your skull isn’t one solid piece. It’s actually made up of several bones with special joints between them. This allows it to expand so your brain has room to grow. Normally, the skull bones come together only after your head reaches its full size. But with this syndrome, the plates join together too early. The skull can’t expand as the brain grows, which affects the shape of the head and face. There are three types of Pfeiffer syndrome. All of them affect a child’s appearance, but types 2 and 3 are more severe. They can cause delays in development, as well as other issues with the brain and nervous system.

These conditions cannot be prevented. Most scientists believe clefts are due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There appears to be a greater chance of clefting in a newborn if a sibling, parent, or relative has had the problem. Another potential cause may be related to a medication a mother may have taken during their pregnancy. Some drugs may cause cleft lip and cleft palate. Among them: anti-seizure/anticonvulsant drugs, acne drugs containing Accutane, and methotrexate, a drug commonly used for treating cancer, arthritis, and psoriasis. Cleft lip and cleft palate may also occur as a result of exposure to viruses or chemicals while the fetus is developing in the womb. In other situations, cleft lip and cleft palate may be part of another medical condition.",,"A cleft lip may require one or two surgeries depending on the extent of the repair needed. The initial surgery is usually performed by the time a baby is 3 months old. Repair of a cleft palate often requires multiple surgeries over the course of 18 years. The first surgery to repair the palate usually occurs when the baby is between 6 and 12 months old. The initial surgery creates a functional palate, reduces the chances that fluid will develop in the middle ears, and aids in the proper development of the teeth and facial bones. Children with a cleft palate may also need a bone graft when they are about 8 years old to fill in the upper gum line so that it can support permanent teeth and stabilize the upper jaw. About 20% of children with a cleft palate require further surgeries to help improve their speech. Once the permanent teeth grow in, braces are often needed to straighten the teeth. Additional surgeries may be performed to improve the appearance of the lip and nose, close openings between the mouth and nose, help breathing, and stabilize and realign the jaw. Final repairs of the scars left by the initial surgery will probably not be performed until adolescence, when the facial structure is more fully developed."
Clival Chordoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-chordoma,"In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born.In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form.

Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.","Your treatment will depend on:Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.  Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully."
Cloning,https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/features/cloning-facts-fiction,"Before you decide where you stand on this debate, you'll need to understand where the science is today. To put it all in perspective, WebMD asked some renowned scientists to explain precisely what cloning is and what it isn't. Popular depictions -- from the ominous hordes of worker drones in the futuristic novel Brave New World to Michael Keaton's comic time-saving duplicates in the film Multiplicity -- have almost nothing to do with reality. ""Clones are genetically identical individuals,"" says Harry Griffin, PhD. ""Twins are clones."" Griffin is assistant director of the Roslin Institute -- the lab in Edinburgh, Scotland, where Dolly the cloned sheep was created in 1997.Usually, after sperm and egg meet, the fertilized cell begins dividing. Remaining in a clump, the one becomes two, then four, eight, 16, and so on. These cells become increasingly specialized to a particular function and organize into organs and systems. Eventually, it's a baby. Sometimes, though, after the first division, the two cells split apart. They continue dividing separately, growing to become two individuals with the exact same genetic make-up -- identical twins, or clones. This phenomenon, though not entirely understood, is far from unusual. We've all known identical twins. Early on, says Griffin, the term cloning referred to embryo splitting -- doing in the lab what happens in the woman's body to create identical twins. ""It was first done in cattle, but there are one or two human examples."" Those human embryos were never implanted, he says. ""Twins were not deliberately created, but they certainly could be."" When we speak of cloning nowadays, however, we're referring not to embryo splitting, but to a process called nuclear transfer. ""The importance is that with nuclear transfer, you can copy an existing individual, and that's why there's controversy,"" says Griffin.",,,,
Clostridium Difficile Colitis,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/clostridium-difficile-colitis,"Clostridium difficile (C. diff) is a type of bacteria that can cause colitis, a serious inflammation of the colon. Infections from C. diff often start after you've been taking antibiotics. It can sometimes be life-threatening.","When you have C. diff, the symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms can include problems like: In more serious infections, there may be blood or pus in the stool. This can happen because C. diff can cause the colon -- also called the large intestine -- to get inflamed. When this happens, tissue in the colon can bleed or make pus. Other symptoms of a serious infection include: If your C. diff infection is severe, you could get severe intestinal inflammation. Your colon could also get enlarged and you could develop an extreme response to infection called sepsis. All of these problems are serious and could send you to the hospital. If your diarrhea from C. diff is very severe, get medical help quickly. Severe diarrhea can lead to life-threatening dehydration.","C. diff exists all around us. It's in the air, water, soil, and in the feces of humans and animals. C. diff bacteria that are outside the body turn into spores that can live on surfaces for weeks or months. These spores are not ""active,"" but they can turn active after you swallow them and they get into your intestines. Some people have the bacteria in their intestines and never have any symptoms. But for others, the bacteria make toxins that attack the intestines. A new strain of C. diff bacteria makes larger amounts of toxins. These types are hard to treat with medications. C. diff bacteria spread in health care facilities, like hospitals or nursing homes, where workers are more likely to come into contact with it and then with patients or residents.You can also become infected if you touch clothing, sheets, or other surfaces that have come in contact with feces and then touch your mouth or nose.","If your doctor suspects you have this infection, they'll probably order one or more stool tests. They include: If your doctor suspects serious problems with your colon, they might order X-rays or a CT scan of your intestines. In rare cases, your doctor may examine your colon with procedures such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.","Antibiotics may have triggered your infection, but some types of these drugs target C. diff. They include: Talk with your doctor about the side effects of these antibiotics. It's important to replace fluids that you lost from diarrhea. Drink plenty of fluids that have water, salt, and sugar, such as broth and fruit juices. If there's been damage to your intestines, you may need surgery to remove the affected areas. Sometimes, a C. diff infection can come back. Doctors sometimes recommend a treatment to help repopulate the colon with healthy bacteria. It's often done by putting another person's stool in your colon using a device called a colonoscope. The procedure is called fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Donors are screened carefully to make sure they're not passing along infections or parasites."

They gently stretch the baby’s foot some more, puts it in a new position, and puts on a new cast. They'll continue this pattern for weeks or months. Your doctor may take X-rays to be sure the baby’s bones are slowly moving into their correct positions. If the series of casts helps to correct your baby’s clubfoot, they’ll need to wear a special brace or shoe to keep it at the right angle until after they've learned to walk. This is because a clubfoot tends to turn back to its original position. Some children may only need to wear the brace or shoe for a short time. Others may need it for a few years to make sure the foot stays at the right angle. Surgery.

Cluster Headaches,https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/cluster-headaches,"You get a cluster headache when a nerve pathway in the base of your brain is triggered.

The nerve that's affected, the trigeminal nerve, is responsible for sensations such as heat or pain in your face. It's near your eye, and it branches up to your forehead, across your cheek, down your jaw, and above your ear on the same side. A brain condition, such as a tumor or aneurysm, won't cause these headaches.","The pain usually starts suddenly, often around or behind the eye. You may notice: Cluster headaches are more common in people who smoke or who are heavy drinkers. During a cluster period, you'll be more sensitive to alcohol and nicotine. Just a bit of alcohol can trigger a headache. But drinking won't trigger one during headache-free periods.",,,"You have several options when it comes to treating cluster headaches: MedicationsAcute attack treatments help when the headache hits: Preventive medicine can often stop a headache before it starts. Your doctor can prescribe medication to make a cluster shorter and make attacks less severe, including: Occipital nerve block (your doctor may also call it occipital nerve injection). The doctor will inject a mix of anesthetic and steroid into these nerves. They’re at the base of your skull, and they’re often the starting point for headaches. This is a temporary treatment until a preventive can start to work."
CMTC,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/cutis-marmorata-telangiectatica-congenita,"The main sign is the blue or purple marbled pattern on the skin. It looks a lot like what happens to a baby’s skin when they’re cold, but it’s more defined and doesn’t go away. Most children get it on the legs, but it can happen on the arms, torso, or very rarely, the face and scalp. The pattern may get larger when your child moves, cries, or gets cold.  It doesn’t happen often, but CMTC can also cause:","The main sign is the blue or purple marbled pattern on the skin.

It doesn’t happen often, but CMTC can also cause:","This is a much harder question to answer. CMTC is rare and doctors are always learning more about it. It’s not common, but because CMTC may affect growth of the limb where it appears, your child could have one leg or arm that’s longer than the other. Some children with CMTC in their legs also get superficial venous insufficiency -- that’s where the veins in the legs have trouble pushing blood back up to the heart. Beyond those two problems, it’s less clear. In the past, it looked like children with CMTC were also sometimes born with issues ranging from pressure buildup in the eye (glaucoma) to muscle loss. But more recent studies seem to show that these children don’t have CMTC. Instead, they have other conditions such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Cowden's disease.","Your doctor will talk to you about your child’s health history and do a physical exam. That’s typically enough to know if it’s CMTC. If your doctor thinks there’s a different problem, your child may get some imaging, such as an X-ray, CT, or MRI. If CMTC shows on the face or scalp, your child may get an eye exam and a neurological exam, which checks to make sure their brain, nerves, and spinal cord work as normal.","Often, children with CMTC don’t need treatment and the skin pattern goes away on its own. Usually, the pattern fades the most by the time your child is one, and it will continue to fade as your child’s skin thickens. In many cases, it’s gone within the first few years of life. And once it fades, it doesn’t come back. Even without treatment, you’ll likely have regular visits with your doctor to keep an eye out for any issues. This is especially important since doctors are always learning about CMTC and similar diseases.Your child may need treatment in the following cases: Your doctor will recommend a plan to treat these or any other symptoms. For example, if your child has bleeding, you’ll get special bandages for it. If that happens a lot, they may get treated with a device called a pulse dye laser. It destroys the blood vessels that cause problems even after CMTC has faded. It’s very effective, doesn’t harm the skin, and usually doesn’t cause scars. Also, CMTC may create some anxiety for you and your child. The pattern may not fade completely, and that can be hard on an older child if it’s easily seen, especially on the face or neck. Your doctor can help you find a counselor to support your family.Sometimes, a condition has a name that’s much scarier than the problems it causes. That’s usually the case with cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita, or CMTC. CMTC is a rare disease. It causes a blue or purple pattern on the skin that looks marbled or like fishnet. It generally shows up at birth or shortly after. Most often, it doesn’t need treatment and is just an issue of looks. It gets better as your child gets older. The pattern is formed by blood vessels near the skin that are wider than normal, but doctors don’t know what causes it. Once in a while, another family member also has CMTC, but that’s not typical. More often, it happens at random, and it doesn’t seem that anything during pregnancy triggers it."
CMV,https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/guide/aids-hiv-opportunistic-infections-cytomegalovirus,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus. Over half of adults in the U.S. have it in their body by age 40. CMV spreads easily through an infected person’s saliva or other body fluids. It’s related to the herpes virus, which gives you cold sores. If you have a healthy immune system that can easily control the virus, it usually doesn't cause problems. But it can make people who have weakened immune systems sick. In people who have advanced HIV, CMV can cause an eye infection called retinitis that may lead to blindness. CMV retinitis is what’s known as an AIDS-defining condition. The virus could also affect your intestines, esophagus, lungs, brain, or nerves. There are different types of cytomegalovirus infection.","General symptoms of primary CMV Most healthy people who get CMV don't know it. If you have symptoms of primary CMV, they're mild and include: Less common symptoms of primary CMV In rare cases, CMV can also cause: Symptoms of congenital CMV Babies born with CMV might have: Symptoms of CMV with HIV If you also have advanced HIV, CMV can affect different parts of your body. You could have: If you have HIV, you probably won’t get sick with CMV unless your CD4 count, a type of white blood cell, is below 100.","You probably won't catch CMV from casual contact. But you can get it by touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after having contact with an infected person's: You can also get cytomegalovirus through: CMV spreads easily in places with lots of young children, like day-care centers, so anyone who spends time there is at higher risk of getting it. You’re also more likely to get the virus if your immune system is weakened because of a medication or another health condition.",Your doctor will order tests such as:,"When you have retinitis because of CMV, your doctor may give you strong medications intravenously (through a vein) for a couple of weeks, a process called induction therapy. After a while, they may switch you to pills. You might have medication injected into your eye if your vision is in danger. Your doctor might prescribe drugs including: These drugs generally can't cure the disease if you have advanced HIV, but they can control it while you get antiretroviral therapy (ART) for your HIV infection. Depending on the medicine, you could have side effects including: Most important, if you take ART early in an HIV infection, the drugs will keep it from getting worse and will keep you from getting CMV in the first place."

Cold Agglutinin Disease,https://www.webmd.com/women/what-is-cold-agglutinin-disease,"When you breathe in, your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Then they carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for you to breathe out. A typical red blood cell lives about 120 days. Your body’s immune system makes proteins called antibodies that help you fight off infections. Some of these antibodies are called cold agglutinins because they’re triggered when your body’s temperature is below normal. With CAD, those antibodies attach themselves to red blood cells instead of to bacteria or viruses and eventually kill the red blood cells. When they do that faster than your body can replace red blood cells, it leads to a condition called anemia, which is when your body doesn’t have enough red blood cells. ","CAD can make you feel weak and tired. Other signs of it include: In women, cold agglutinin disease sometimes keeps them from having periods. Some people who have cold agglutinin disease also may get a cold, numb feeling and loss of color in their fingers or toes, known as Raynaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms are typically worse in the winter, when temperature are lower.","Most of the time, cold agglutinin disease happens by itself, without any other related health problem. Doctors call that the primary, or idiopathic, form of the condition, and they don’t know why it happens. In other cases, another illness can bring on cold agglutinin disease. One of the most common conditions that triggers it is lymphoma, especially in people over 60. That's a type of cancer that affects your lymph nodes. But it also can happen if you have:","If your doctor thinks you have cold agglutinin disease, blood tests can tell. A nurse or lab technician will take a sample of your blood so it can be looked at under a microscope. Your doctor may also feel your midsection to see if your liver or spleen is larger than it should be.","This depends on how serious your symptoms are and whether CAD happened on its own or because of another illness.If you have another condition that’s led to CAD, your doctor will try to treat that first and see if it helps your symptoms. For example, if it was brought on by bacteria or a virus, your symptoms may go away a few months after you get over the infection. If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. You may be able to avoid problems by keeping warm and staying out of cold weather. If your red blood cell count is very low, your doctor may need to filter your blood to get rid of the antibodies that are causing your condition (a procedure called plasmapheresis) or give you a blood transfusion. These are short-term treatments that can give you temporary relief, but they don’t do anything about the cause of the problem. If your anemia is severe, you may need to take medication. The only drug approved to specifically treate CAD is sutimlimab-jome (Enjaymo). It works by inhibiting the destruction of red blood cells and so decreases the need for blood transfusions."

Coronavirus (COVID-19),https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. In early 2020,  the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 as a new type of coronavirus. The outbreak quickly spread around the world.  It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs). It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do, mainly through person-to-person contact. Infections range from mild to deadly. SARS-CoV-2 is one of seven types of coronavirus, including the ones that cause severe diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The other coronaviruses cause most of the colds that affect us during the year but aren't a serious threat to otherwise healthy people. Is there more than one strain of SARS-CoV-2? Yes, the COVID-19 virus continues to mutate and there are several variants that are now spreading. Some are more contagious as well as more deadly than the original virus. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have kept a close eye on variants like: How long will the coronavirus last? There's no way to tell how long the pandemic will continue. There are many factors, including the public's efforts to slow the spread, researchers' work to learn more about the virus, their search for a treatment, and the success of the vaccines.","The main symptoms include: The virus can lead to pneumonia, respiratory failure, heart problems, liver problems, septic shock, and death. Many COVID-19 complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs. In some cases, lung transplants have been needed.If you notice the following severe symptoms in yourself or a loved one, get medical help right away: Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST: If you're infected, symptoms can show up in as few as 2 days or as many as 14. It varies from person to person. According to researchers in China, these were the most common symptoms among people who had COVID-19:","Anyone can get COVID-19, and most infections are mild. The older you are, the higher your risk of severe illness. You also a have higher chance of serious illness if you have one of these health conditions: Conditions that could lead to severe COVID-19 illness include: Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory condition that doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Doctors think it may be linked to the virus. It causes symptoms similar to those of toxic shock and of Kawasaki disease, a condition that causes inflammation in kids' blood vessels.","Call your doctor or local health department if you think you've been exposed and have symptoms like: Home testing has advanced considerably since the beginning of the pandemic and you can readily test yourself. Otherwise, testing facilities are readily available in most areas. While some require an appointment, others are simply drive-up. Home testing kits are also widely available. A swab test is the most common testing method. It looks for signs of the virus in your upper respiratory tract. You or the person giving the test puts a swab up your nose to get a sample from the back of your nose and throat. That sample usually goes to a lab that looks for viral material, but some areas may have rapid tests that give results in as little as 15 minutes.If there are signs of the virus, the test is positive. A negative test could mean there is no virus or there wasn't enough to measure. That can happen early in an infection. It usually takes 24 hours to get results, but the tests must be collected, stored, shipped to a lab, and processed. The FDA has granted authorizations for several at-home nasal swab tests, which you collect yourself and express ship back to the lab for analysis as well as at-home rapid tests. You can buy these over the counter in pharmacies, at retail stores, or online. At-home tests are also available for free at some local health departments or federally qualified health centers. A swab test can only tell whether you have the virus in your body at that moment. But you may also consider taking an antibody test which can show whether you've ever been exposed to the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in officials' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is. In time, it might also help them figure out who's immune to the virus. The FDA is working with laboratories across the country to develop more tests.","There's no specific treatment for COVID-19. People who get a mild case need care to ease their symptoms, like rest, fluids, and fever control. Take over-the-counter medicine for a sore throat, body aches, and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens younger than 19. You might have heard that you shouldn't take ibuprofen to treat COVID-19 symptoms. But the National Institutes of Health says people who have the virus can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen as usual. Antibiotics won't help because they treat bacteria, not viruses. In January 2022, the FDA limited the use of two monoclonal treatments that previously were used to treat COVID-19 infections after it was found that they were not effective against the Omicron variant. These two monoclonal antibody treatments are bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab).Sotrovimab is the only available monoclonal treatment with activity against the Omicron variant.  Many clinical trials are underway to explore treatments used for other conditions that could fight COVID-19 and to develop new ones.A variety of steroid medications are being used including dexamethasone which is used to treat conditions such as arthritis, blood/hormone/immune system disorders, and allergic reactions. More studies on effectiveness are still being conducted. Is there a cure for the coronavirus? There's no cure yet, but researchers are working hard to find one."

While in general, your overall risk of getting seriously ill is low, your chances of getting severely ill from COVID-19 are higher while you're pregnant. You are also at risk for about 42 days afterward giving birth. Pregnant people who have COVID-19 with symptoms are more likely than non-pregnant people who have COVID-19 to need treatment in an intensive care unit, need a ventilator to help with breathing, or to die from the disease.   In addition, pregnant people with COVID-19 are also at increased risk for delivering the baby earlier than 37 weeks and might be at increased risk for other poor pregnancy outcomes. A few of the things that can raise your risk of getting severely ill are: What should I do if I have symptoms of COVID-19 or if I come into contact with someone who has the virus?

COVID-19 may cause more serious illness in children who have certain medical conditions and in babies younger than 12 months. In some cases, children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is a serious condition that requires medical attention (more below). Some very simple and effective ways to help prevent your child from catching or spreading COVID-19 are: You’ll also want to reassure your child if they’re anxious about any changes in their routines, like staying home from school or not seeing friends face-to-face. Watch for unusual worry or sadness, trouble eating or sleeping, and attention problems. Talk to them about what’s happening, and reassure them that most cases of COVID-19 are mild.

Get medical help right away if your child shows any of these symptoms:","Children can get the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but their symptoms tend to be milder than adults’ symptoms, and in many cases, they may have no symptoms at all. Their risk of getting COVID-19 is about the same as that of adults. The risk can be drastically reduced if your child receives the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 may cause more serious illness in children who have certain medical conditions and in babies younger than 12 months. In some cases, children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is a serious condition that requires medical attention (more below). Some very simple and effective ways to help prevent your child from catching or spreading COVID-19 are: You’ll also want to reassure your child if they’re anxious about any changes in their routines, like staying home from school or not seeing friends face-to-face. Watch for unusual worry or sadness, trouble eating or sleeping, and attention problems. Talk to them about what’s happening, and reassure them that most cases of COVID-19 are mild. Your children will pick up cues from you, so it’s important that you stay calm, too.",,"There’s one FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment for certain kids under 12 years old. It’s a shot called remdesivir (Veklury). It’s for children 28 days of age and older who weigh about 7 pounds at least, and are either:Remdesivir can cause side effects. There’s a chance it could raise a child’s levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury. It could also trigger an allergic reaction, which may include signs like: Get medical help right away if you think your child is having side effects. Dial 911 if they’re having trouble breathing. Paxlovid is used to treat adults and children 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of the disease becoming severe. Paxlovid should be taken as soon as possible after you’re diagnosed and within 5 days of your symptoms starting. Remdesivir and Paxlovid are not substitutes for the COVID-19 vaccine in children who are eligible. Your child should still get the COVID vaccine if they are 6-months or older."

"Coronavirus, Types",https://www.webmd.com/covid/coronavirus-strains,"The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first detected in specimens collected on Nov. 11, 2021, in Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021. They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly began to go up. The WHO grouped Omicron as a VOC. This category means the variant might have higher transmissibility, cause more intense disease, and may be less likely to respond to vaccines or treatments.  The Omicron variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S. Experts are keeping a close eye on how the variant spreads or develops. So, far, the Omicron variant has been found to carry a higher risk of reinfection compared to other variants and while it can still be deadly, most infections are not as serious. Breakthrough infections are possible with the Omicron variant even if you’re fully vaccinated. However, COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are still effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.Current PCR tests for COVID-19 can effectively find Omicron cases. Experts found that one specific PCR test doesn't identify one of the three target genes (called the S gene dropout) in people infected with Omicron. Because of this, these tests can specifically mark positive Omicron cases and, because of that, can detect this variant faster than with previous surges. In the meantime, experts recommend protecting yourself by getting the vaccine or a booster if you’re eligible for it. Wear a mask and maintain social distance if the COVID-19 community level is high or if you prefer to be masked.  Also wear a mask if you or a family member are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease even if the community level is at medium. If you test positive for COVID or if you’ve come in close contact with someone who has it, follow the CDC guidelines for quarantine and isolation. Call your doctor if you notice symptoms. Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2): Scientists call it Omicron BA.2 as opposed to the original Omicron variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away.

They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth, nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form. Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications.","The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders  cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore.","When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders. Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters. Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as: Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include: Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them.","You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed.

Cranial Arteritis,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis,"With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.  Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux.""","Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:  ",,,"There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called ""steroids"" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly."

Genetic testing can usually identify Apert syndrome or another cause of abnormal skull formation.,"Apert syndrome has no known cure. Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months.2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too. Other Apert syndrome treatments include: Other surgeries may be beneficial for certain children with Apert syndrome, depending on their individual pattern of facial bone formation problems."

It's also not linked to ""variant"" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease.","The symptoms start and worsen very quickly. People with CJD often have signs of dementia, including: Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma.","There are three types of classic CJD. Each has a different cause: Sporadic: This is the most common type. It's caused by harmful proteins in the body called prions. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. This “misfolded” prion infects the brain and destroys brain cells. Scientists don’t know why this happens. Familial: This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial. Acquired: The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that’s infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases. ","There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse. A few tests doctors can use include: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This brain scan puts together detailed images. Doctors use these images to see changes in the brain over time. Electroencephalogram (EEG). This is another type of scan that measures the electrical activity in the brain. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins.","There are no treatments for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease. Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti-seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage."

Adults can get it, too, with women being more susceptible to it than men. The condition is most prevalent in spring and summer.Doctors aren't sure why some viruses lead to a Gianotti-Crosti response. There is a broad assumption that it's part of the immune response to viruses, but experts don't know exactly why some people get it while others don't‌.  The most common triggers for Gianotti-Crosti in the United States include: In regions other than the United States, hepatitis B is a common trigger for Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. In the United States, children are usually vaccinated against hepatitis B. If your child has not been vaccinated for hepatitis B, you may need to have them tested if symptoms manifest.",,"The main symptom -- the rash -- will go away on its own. But if it’s itchy, you can use over-the-counter anti-itch treatments to ease the symptoms. Your doctor may suggest oral antihistamines if topical treatments don't help. Cool compresses may also reduce itching. If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about using a fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ask about appropriate dosing for your child's age. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids, since fevers can be dehydrating.  Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is not contagious, so you don't need to isolate your child while they have the rash. In fact, the rash usually appears after the child has stopped being contagious with the virus that triggered the syndrome. Your child can participate in activities while the rash is still present, though you may need a note from your doctor to explain the situation.Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rash that usually affects young children. It's sometimes called papular acrodermatitis of childhood. The rash covers the arms, legs, and face. It can cause itching and discomfort. Gianotti-Crosti is usually a delayed immune reaction to a virus. The rash will appear as your child is recovering from an illness such as a respiratory infection or stomach virus. It's very common and doesn't have lasting effects, but it can be alarming when it appears on your child's skin."
Croup,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-croup-basic-information,"Croup is more common in the fall and early winter. It’s more common in boys than in girls. Babies and children between 3 months and 5 years of age are most at risk. The condition is contagious, especially in the first few days or until your child’s fever is gone. Viral croup is caused by any virus that infects the voice box (also called the larynx) and windpipe (the trachea). The virus that most often causes croup is parainfluenza. The symptoms are mild at first but get worse.Spasmodic croup is rare. It comes on suddenly, often in the middle of the night. Doctors believe it may be caused by an allergy or reflux from the stomach. That happens when contents from your baby’s stomach move back up into their esophagus. Other things can also cause a cough that sounds like croup. Your child may have breathed in something with fine particles, like powder or flour. A food allergy can cause their throat to swell closed. If you suspect a food allergy, call 911 right away. Other infections, including epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis, have similar symptoms.","Croup might start out like a cold. But over time, your child will develop a “barky” cough. They also may make a high-pitched, wheezing sound in their lower airway when they breathe in. The croup sound in the upper airway is a harsh, loud sound known as “stridor.” There can be a low fever too. Symptoms tend to be worse at night. Your baby might also have redness around their eyes, swollen lymph nodes, or a rash. Any time your child has trouble breathing, retractions (when their skin pulls tight around their ribs), or stridor at rest, immediately call your doctor or 911. Stridor when crying, agitated, or playing, or a barky cough is not an emergency.

As the airway below their vocal cords becomes narrow, your child will find it hard to breathe. Their breathing will be noisy and they’ll have a cough that sounds a lot like a high-pitched seal or dog bark. Their voice will also sound raspy and hoarse, especially when they cry.     Most often, croup is caused by an infection. There are two types of this condition -- viral and spasmodic.

Croup Treatment,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-croup-treatment,"Give them fluids. It’s important to keep your baby hydrated if they have croup. Warm, clear fluids can help loosen mucus and take pressure off their vocal cords. If they’re very young or really cranky, give them small amounts of fluid using a spoon or medicine dropper. Keep their head elevated. Prop up your little one’s head with an extra pillow when they turn in at night. But don’t use pillows with babies under 12 months of age.

Curvature of the Spine (Scoliosis),https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/causes-scoliosis,"Scoliosis is a sideways curve in your backbone (or spine). Often, it shows up when you're a child or teenager. The angle of the curve may be small, large, or somewhere in between. But anything that measures more than 10 degrees on an X-ray is considered scoliosis. Doctors may use the letters ""C"" and ""S"" to describe the curve.","If you have scoliosis, you might lean a little when you stand. You could also have: In addition to visible symptoms, scoliosis may lead to:","Some kinds of scoliosis have clear causes. Doctors divide those curves into two categories -- structural and nonstructural.In nonstructural scoliosis, the spine works normally but looks curved. This happens for a number of reasons, such as having one leg that's longer than the other, muscle spasms, and inflammations like appendicitis. When these problems are treated, the scoliosis often goes away. In structural scoliosis, the curve of the spine is rigid and can’t be reversed. Causes include: For idiopathic scoliosis, family history and genetics can be risk factors. If you or one of your children has this condition, make sure your other kids are checked regularly. Scoliosis shows up most often during growth spurts, usually when kids are between 10 and 15 years old. About the same number of boys and girls are diagnosed with minor idiopathic scoliosis. But curves in girls are 10 times more likely to get worse and may need to be treated. Scoliosis diagnosed during the teen years can continue into adulthood. The more your spine is curved, the more likely it is to get worse over time. If you had scoliosis in the past, have your doctor check your back regularly.","To check for scoliosis, your doctor might first ask you to bend over from the waist so they can see if your spine looks curved. Pediatricians often do this kind of exam on children. If your back looks curved, they'll likely do an X-ray to see whether it's scoliosis. Your doctor might also do an MRI to rule out things like a tumor that could cause your spine to curve.","For mild scoliosis, you may not need treatment. Instead, your doctor might watch you and take X-rays once in a while to see if it's getting worse. Some children grow out of scoliosis.

Cushing's Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/cushing-syndrome,"  Cushing's syndrome is a hormonal disorder caused by high levels of the hormone cortisol in your body. It’s also known as hypercortisolism. Cortisol comes from your adrenal glands, which sit on top of your kidneys. It helps your body: But when you have too much cortisol, it can throw off your body's other systems. Most cases of Cushing's syndrome can be cured, though it may take some time for your symptoms to ease up. The condition is more common in women than in men. It's most often seen in people ages 25-40.","Your case might be different than someone else's, but when the disease is full-blown, common symptoms are: Your skin could become thin, heal slowly, and bruise easily. You might get purple or pink stretch marks all over your body, especially on your belly, thighs, arms, and chest. Your bones may get weak. Everyday movements like bending, lifting, or even getting out of a chair can cause backaches or breaks in your ribs or spine. Children with Cushing's syndrome are usually very heavy, what doctors call obese, and tend to grow slowly.","You can get Cushing's syndrome when there’s too much cortisol in your body for too long. The most common cause is related to medications called glucocorticoids, also commonly known as corticosteroids, steroids (for example, prednisone). These prescription steroids are used for conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or after an organ transplant. They’re powerful anti-inflammatory medications. Taking too much, for too long, can lead to Cushing's syndrome.Although rare, you can also get Cushing’s syndrome from injectable steroids, such as repeated shots for joint pain, bursitis, and back pain. Steroid skin creams, used for eczema and other skin problems, are less likely to cause Cushing’s syndrome, but it can happen. A tumor in your pituitary gland found at the base of the brain, or a tumor in the adrenal glands, can also prompt your body to make too much cortisol, which can lead to Cushing’s. ACTH is a hormone that regulates cortisol. In rare cases, an ACTH-secreting tumor causes Cushing’s syndrome. This kind of tumor can form in an organ that doesn’t naturally produce ACTH, but because of the tumor, it begins to make a lot of it. These tumors can be cancerous or noncancerous. They’re usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid, or thymus gland. It's not usually a condition that's passed along in families. In some rare cases, though, people have it because a problem in their genes makes them more likely to get tumors on their glands.","It might take several appointments to settle on your diagnosis. When you go to your doctor, they'll do a physical exam and ask you questions. Your doctor will probably also recommend some of these tests to help screen for Cushing’s syndrome if they suspect you have it: 24-hour urinary free cortisol test. This common test collects your urine for 24 hours to measure how much cortisol is in it. Dexamethasone suppression test. You’ll take a low-dose steroid pill at 11:00 p.m. and then take a blood test in the morning to see how much cortisol your body still makes. Late-night salivary cortisol level. This test measures cortisol in your saliva. As the name suggests, these tests happen at night. If you have Cushing's syndrome, your doctor may refer you to a specialist who will do other blood tests or imaging scans to find out what's causing it.  ",The first thing your doctor will figure out is why you have too much cortisol. That will lead to how to treat your condition.Lifestyle changes Some lifestyle changes may help you manage your Cushing’s syndrome and stay healthier:  
Cyclic Edema,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/edema-overview,"Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It’s more common if you’re older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup.Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it’s worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area.","Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a “pit” that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it’s called non-pitting edema. It’s a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema.","Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area.Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it’s not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness.Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body.",,"To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide (Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help.""Edema"" is the medical term for swelling. Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body."

You might also get an imaging test with an MRI machine. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to take a picture of your body’s internal organs. Your doctor may also give you a pudendal nerve block. This is a shot you get in your pelvis to numb the nerve and see if your symptoms go away.","Most people with pudendal neuralgia get treatment with a combination of physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and medicines. Sit up straight or stand more often to help with nerve pain. This can take pressure off the pudendal nerve. Don’t do squats or cycle. Certain exercises can make pudendal neuralgia worse. Go for physical therapy. It relaxes and stretches the muscles at the lower end of your pelvis, known as the pelvic floor. This can ease pressure that may irritate the pudendal nerve. If pudendal neuralgia makes it hard to control your bladder or bowels, physical therapy can help with that, too. Try prescription medication. Muscle relaxants may help relieve symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. Drugs used to treat other conditions, like depression or epilepsy, might also help. If these don’t work, your doctor may give you a shot of medications that numb the nerve or lower inflammation, which lessens pressure. These may take several weeks to fully take effect.

It affects the way your body makes mucus, a substance that helps your organs and systems work. Mucus should be thin and slippery, but when you have CF, it becomes thick and glue-like. This blocks tubes and ducts throughout your body. Over time, this thick mucus builds up inside your airways. This makes it hard to breathe. The mucus traps germs and leads to infections. It can also cause severe lung damage like cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and fibrosis (scar tissue). That’s how CF got its name. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. live with cystic fibrosis. Doctors diagnose about 1,000 new cases each year.",People with CF can have symptoms including:,"Cystic fibrosis is caused by a change, or mutation, in a gene called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This gene controls the flow of salt and fluids in and out of your cells. If the CFTR gene doesn’t work the way it should, a sticky mucus builds up in your body. To get CF, you have to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from both of your parents. Ninety percent of those with affected have at least one copy of the F508del mutation. If you inherit only one copy, you won’t have any symptoms, but you will be a carrier of the disease. That means there’s a chance you could pass it to your children. About 10 million Americans are CF carriers. Every time two CF carriers have a baby, there’s a 25% (1 in 4) chance that their baby will be born with CF.",Early diagnosis means early treatment and better health later in life. Every state in the U.S. tests newborns for cystic fibrosis using one or more of these three tests: Some people who weren’t tested at birth aren’t diagnosed with CF until they become adults.

Cystic Fibrosis Carrier Screening,https://www.webmd.com/children/how-do-doctors-diagnose-cystic-fibrosis,"All 50 states and the District of Columbia screen babies for severe health conditions such as CF. This is often done with a blood test a few days after birth. A doctor or nurse will draw a few drops of blood from your baby’s heel and send the sample to a lab. There, it’s checked for a chemical made by the pancreas called immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). The IRT-based test is just a screening test -- it’s not meant to make a diagnosis. Most babies who “fail” the IRT screen don’t have cystic fibrosis -- they just have a higher risk and need another test to confirm. If results from the second test are normal, there’s no further risk or need for more testing.",,,"If your doctor thinks you might have CF and you weren’t tested at birth, they may suggest that you have both a genetic test and a sweat test. Repeated bouts of pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas), nasal polyps, or frequent sinus and lung infections, are some things that may trigger your doctor’s concern.Doctors use many different tests to confirm that you or a loved one has cystic fibrosis (CF). These include tests that check your blood and sweat, and sometimes your stool. Your symptoms will also need to be reviewed by a doctor who specializes in this genetic disease.

Cystic Hygroma,https://www.webmd.com/baby/cystic-hygroma-explained,"A cystic hygroma is a rare type of cyst that babies can get, usually in their head or neck, if their lymphatic system gets blocked while it’s growing. (This system helps filter out harmful things, including germs.) Doctors often find cystic hygromas before a baby is born. Only one in 8,000 babies is born with this kind of cyst. Some of them may also have certain birth defects. So if your baby has a cystic hygroma, your doctor will probably suggest tests to check for other problems. But some babies born with a cystic hygroma are healthy. Sometimes these cysts go away on their own. If not, it’s important to get surgery to remove a cystic hygroma so it doesn’t harm nearby areas of the body, become infected, or make your baby uncomfortable as they grow.","Symptoms of a cystic hygroma depend on where and how big it is. The growth may make it hard for nearby organs and other body parts to work the way they should.In newborn babies, a cystic hygroma looks like a bulge under the skin, which may be slightly blue. Babies born with this type of cyst often have a hard time eating and may grow more slowly than those without cystic hygromas. If a cystic hygroma is near the throat, your baby may have trouble breathing. These cysts can become infected. Left untreated, the cystic hygroma can harm nearby bones and teeth. The cystic hygroma will get bigger as your baby grows, and it may grow quickly if the cyst becomes infected or there is bleeding inside it.","Both a baby’s genes and their environment in the womb can cause problems with the way their lymphatic system grows. This is how cystic hygromas form. It may happen on its own or with genetic conditions such as Turner, Down, or Noonan syndromes. When adults get a cystic hygroma, it can be due to trauma or a past respiratory infection. But it’s often not clear what caused the cyst. It may even disappear during pregnancy.","When you’re pregnant, your doctor may find your baby’s cystic hygroma during a routine ultrasound. These cysts are usually found by the 20th week of pregnancy. You may also notice it after your baby is born or even later in your child’s life. If you find out while you’re pregnant that your baby has a cystic hygroma, the doctor will probably recommend genetic testing to see if there are other problems. These can include:  You’ll also have frequent ultrasounds to watch for changes in the cyst and any complications.  The doctor will likely plan for you to give birth by C-section at 38 weeks. Find a hospital where you have access to both neonatal intensive care and pediatric surgeons. The doctor can help you choose one. If your child has signs of a cystic hygroma after they’re born, they may get tests including chest X-ray, ultrasound, and an MRI or CT scan to diagnose the cyst.","Doctors use surgery to remove a cystic hygroma. If parts of it are left behind, there’s a 15% chance it will come back. Though they don’t work as well as surgery, there are other options, such as:"
Cystic Lung Disease,https://www.webmd.com/lung/what-is-cystic-lung-disease,"LAM happens when muscle cells in the lung tissue grow out of control and form cysts, which eventually damage your lung tissue. It mostly affects women between ages 20 and 40. There are two types: TSC-LAM and sporadic LAM. TSC-LAM is when you have LAM and a rare disease called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). Sporadic LAM means you have LAM but not TSC. Both kinds are thought to be due to changes in the tuberous sclerosis gene. Doctors believe that estrogen plays a part in both types of LAM. The disease may get worse during menstruation and pregnancy, and after using birth control pills with estrogen. The most common symptoms of LAM are: You may also have fluid collect in the space between your lungs and chest wall, a problem called pleural effusion. It can make it hard to catch your breath. Fluid can also build up in your belly, legs, and feet.You might get a collapsed lung if a cyst tears through the lining of your lung. A collapsed lung happens when air leaks into the space between your lung and chest wall and flattens part of your lung. This is an emergency and needs treatment right away. LAM doesn't have a cure, but you can treat it with sirolimus (Rapamune), a medicine that can slow the disease and may even improve how well your lungs work. You could also take bronchodilators, medicines that can help open up your airways and make breathing easier. LAM can get worse over time.

Deafness,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hearing-loss-causes-symptoms-treatment,"Hearing loss is the condition that results when any part of your ear isn’t working the way it should. It’s the third most common health problem in the U.S, and it can affect the quality of your life and relationships. About 48 million Americans have lost some hearing. You can have three different types of hearing loss, depending on where your hearing is damaged. Your hearing loss can be: Certain conditions, including age, illness, and genetics, may play a role in hearing loss. Modern life has added a host of ear-damaging elements to the list, including some medications and many sources of loud, ongoing noise. Learn more about the common causes of hearing loss. With so many untreatable cases of hearing loss, prevention is the best way to keep hearing long-term. If you've already lost some hearing, there are ways to stay connected and communicate with friends and family. ","In many cases, hearing fades so slowly you don't notice it. You may think people are mumbling more, your spouse needs to speak up, or you need a better phone. As long as some sound still comes in, you could assume your hearing is fine. But you may become more and more cut off from the world of speech and sounds. So how do you know if you are losing your hearing? Doctors classify hearing loss by degrees. Early on, high-pitched sounds, such as children's and female voices, and the sounds ""S"" and ""F"" become harder to make out.

One out of three people between 65 and 74 has some level of hearing loss. After age 75, that goes up to one out of every two people. Researchers don't fully understand why hearing declines with age. It could be that lifetime exposure to noise and other damaging factors slowly wears down the ears' delicate mechanics. Your genes are also part of the mix. Noise wears down hearing if it's loud or continuous. The CDC reports that about 22 million American workers are exposed to dangerous noise levels on the job. This includes many carpenters, construction workers, soldiers, miners, factory workers, and farmers.Musicians are also at risk for noise-induced hearing loss. Some now wear special earplugs to protect their ears when they perform. The earplugs allow them to hear music without harming their ears' inner workings. Certain medications can impair hearing or balance. More than 200 drugs and chemicals have a track record of triggering hearing and balance side effects in addition to their disease-fighting abilities. Sudden hearing loss, the rapid loss of 30 decibels or more of hearing ability, can happen over several hours or up to 3 days. (A normal conversation is 60 decibels.) Sudden hearing loss usually affects only one ear. Although there are up to three new cases per every 10,000 people each year, doctors are not able to discover the cause in most cases. Illnesses such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes put ears at risk by interfering with the ears' blood supply. Otosclerosis is a bone disease of the middle ear, and Ménière's disease affects the inner ear. Both can cause hearing loss. Trauma, especially a skull fracture or punctured eardrum, puts ears at serious risk for hearing loss. Infection or earwax can block ear canals and lessen hearing.

These are some of the ways people can get it: It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water, and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways.

Degenerative Chorea,https://www.webmd.com/brain/hungtingtons-disease-causes-symptoms-treatment,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and deadly disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. This causes physical and mental abilities to weaken, and they get worse over time. There is no cure. If it starts early in life, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s disease. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease may come as quite a shock. There's a lot to take in. But tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can make the journey a bit less daunting. With the help of a healthcare team, people with Huntington's can live independently for many years.","  Although symptoms may first show up in midlife, Huntington's can strike anyone from childhood to advanced age. Symptoms often first appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. Over 10 to 25 years, the disease gradually kills nerve cells in the brain. This affects the body, mind, and emotions. If symptoms begin before age 20, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s Disease and it may get worse faster.Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. And stress or excitement can worsen symptoms. Some symptoms are easier to spot than others. Abnormal movements may be the first thing you notice. Weight loss can be a concern at all stages.

Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders, but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.  Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family.

Limit distractions during meal times.  Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and at stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication."

After numbing the area, they’ll use a very small instrument that works like a cookie-cutter to “punch” out part of your skin. You may need a stitch or two to close up the site. It should heal quickly, with very little scarring. A lab will use dye to see if you have IgA in a certain type of pattern. This tells your doctor whether you have DH.

Your doctor might prescribe dapsone, which you take by mouth. It gets rid of your itching and bumps within 1-3 days. Your doctor may also recommend a topical corticosteroid cream to help with itching. If tests show that you have celiac disease, your doctor will tell you to completely cut gluten out of your diet. Iodine, a common ingredient in salt, can make symptoms worse in some cases. So you may need to avoid that, too. A gluten-free diet is important, but it’s only part of the solution. In most cases, you’ll also need to take medicine to get full relief."

Don’t assume it will get better on its own.","The cause of Meniere’s disease isn’t known, but doctors think they understand how the symptoms of Meniere’s happen. Fluid builds up inside a part of your inner ear called the labyrinth, which holds structures that help with hearing and balance. The extra fluid interferes with the signals your brain receives, causing vertigo and hearing problems. Why people get Meniere’s isn’t clear. Researchers have several theories about what might affect the fluid in the inner ear, though: It’s possible that a combination of issues come together to cause Meniere’s.",You and your doctor will talk about your symptoms and medical history. A series of diagnostic tests can check your balance and hearing. These might include: Additional imaging tests.Your doctor also might recommend an MRI or CT scan to rule out the possibility that something other than Meniere’s is causing your symptoms.,"It’s not clear you can do anything to prevent Meniere’s disease, but you can do a few things to help manage your symptoms. If  you’re having an attack of vertigo: Try to sit down and stay still.  Don’t make sudden movements, and avoid bright light, loud noise, and other triggers. Watching TV or even reading also can be harmful.  Fix your gaze on something steady.  In addition to eating a low-salt diet, you may want to cut down on alcohol and caffeine. Some people think such diet changes lessen the effects of the disease. Tobacco use also can be harmful, as cigarettes have chemicals in them that restrict blood vessels. If this happens in your ears, it can lead to hearing loss. Studies show that smokers are much more likely to have hearing loss than nonsmokers. Vertigo attacks can be triggered by different things in different people. Try to write down as many things as you can remember about the episode. Triggers might include: Stress Overwork Fatigue Sharp changes in weather, specifically air pressure Underlying illness"

DMD,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan.

Dowling-Meara Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/epidermolysis-bullosa-what-is,"There are five major types of epidermolysis bullosa. The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth.","Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers. Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder. If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.","Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system.","To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.","There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."
Down Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-down-syndrome-basics,"Down syndrome is a genetic condition that causes mild to serious physical and developmental problems. People with Down syndrome are born with an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are bundles of genes, and your body relies on having just the right number of them. With Down syndrome, this extra chromosome leads to a range of issues that affect you both mentally and physically. Down syndrome is a lifelong condition. Although it can’t be cured, doctors know more about it now than ever. If your child has it, getting the right care early on can make a big difference in helping them live a full and meaningful life.","Down syndrome can have many effects, and it’s different for each person. Some will grow up to live almost entirely on their own, while others will need more help taking care of themselves. Mental abilities vary, but most people with Down syndrome have mild to moderate issues with thinking, reasoning, and understanding. They’ll learn and pick up new skills their whole lives, but they may take longer to reach important goals like walking, talking, and developing social skills.People with Down syndrome tend to have certain physical features in common. These may include: Many people with Down syndrome don’t have any other health issues, but some do. Common conditions include heart problems and trouble hearing and seeing.","For most people, each cell in your body has 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your mother and the other comes from your father. But with Down syndrome, something goes wrong and you get an extra copy of chromosome 21. That means you have three copies instead of two, which leads to the symptoms of Down syndrome. Doctors aren’t sure why this happens. There’s no link to anything in the environment or anything the parents did or didn’t do.While doctors don’t know what causes it, they do know that women 35 and older have a higher chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. If you’ve already had a child with Down syndrome, you’re more likely to have another one who has it as well. It’s not common, but it is possible to pass Down syndrome from parent to child. Sometimes, a parent has what experts call “translocated” genes. That means some of their genes aren’t in their normal place, perhaps on a different chromosome from where they’d usually be found. The parent doesn’t have Down syndrome because they have the right number of genes, but their child may have what’s called “translocation Down syndrome.” Not everyone with translocation Down syndrome gets it from their parents -- it may also happen by chance.",A doctor may suspect Down syndrome in a newborn based on the baby’s appearance. That can be confirmed by a blood test called a karyotype test that lines up the chromosomes and will show if there’s an extra chromosome 21.,"There’s no specific treatment for Down syndrome. But there is a wide range of physical and developmental therapies designed to help people with Down syndrome reach their full potential. The earlier you start them, the better.

DR Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/duane-syndrome-facts,There are three types of DS:,Signs of DS can include: Some people with DS also have double vision and headaches. You might also have neck pain as a result of tilting our head.,"DS can be passed down in families, but this is rare. Ninety percent of the people who have it are the only ones in their family with it. Experts believe something happens to cause DS between the third and eighth week of pregnancy. This is when a baby's eye nerves and muscles start to develop. There's probably more than one factor involved, like problems with certain genes or the mother being exposed to something in the environment. But it isn't clear what actually causes DS.","Because DS has clear symptoms, most people are diagnosed before age 10. The exam usually includes a close look at your eye along with a vision test and measurements of how far your eye can move. The doctor also may want to do a hearing test and examine your spine, the roof of your mouth, and your hands. A gene called CHN1 is linked to some cases of DS. A genetic test can look for changes, or mutations, in the gene that might be passed on to other family members. This is done with a blood test.","There's no cure for DS. But your doctor can do things to help your eyes line up when you're looking straight ahead and to protect your vision. Prescription glasses or contact lenses can also help. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a patch over the eye you see best with to help avoid lazy eye, or amblyopia. This forces your weaker eye to get stronger. Your doctor may also prescribe special lenses for glasses that shift your vision so you can hold your head in a more natural way.It's important to have regular eye exams -- young children may need to see their doctor every 3 to 6 months so a lazy eye can be treated right away. In severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to help other muscles in your eye make up for the ones that are affected. This won't give you normal eye motion, but it usually reduces the head turning.Duane syndrome (DS) is a rare eye disorder some people are born with. The muscles and nerves around your eye don't work well together, and that keeps it from moving as it should. The disorder is also known as Duane's syndrome, Duane retraction syndrome, or Stilling-Turk syndrome. It happens when the nerves that control the eye muscles don't grow normally during pregnancy or are missing. As a result, some muscles stretch when they should tighten or stay loose when they need to squeeze. DS doesn't cause blindness and doesn't usually lead to other health issues. In very rare cases, it has been linked to problems with bones, eyes, ears, kidneys, and the nervous system. Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. But 20% of people have trouble with both eyes. Women are slightly more likely to have DS than men."

They’ll want to know what you took, whether you’ve ever had a drug reaction or other allergies, and whether you have other medical conditions. Take note of how quickly your symptoms appeared, whether they’ve changed, and whether anything has helped.  If they think you might be allergic to an antibiotic, such as penicillin, they may give you a skin test to confirm it. If you’ve had a serious skin reaction, your doctor may run blood tests to check how your organs are working and to see if there are any other signs of an allergic reaction. But skin testing doesn’t work for all drugs, and in some cases it could be dangerous. If you've had a severe, life-threatening reaction to a particular drug, your doctor will simply rule out that medicine as a treatment option for you. Getting an allergy test to find out if the severe reaction was a ""true"" allergic response isn't needed if there are other drug options.","The first goal is to ease your symptoms. For instance, medicines such as antihistamines, and in some cases, corticosteroids, can often control rash, hives, and itching. For coughing and lung congestion, your doctor may prescribe drugs called bronchodilators to widen your airways. For anaphylaxis symptoms, you may need a shot of epinephrine, and you definitely need emergency medical care, even if those symptoms stop after you take epinephrine. Sometimes, doctors use a process called desensitization to treat an allergy to penicillin or other drugs. Over time, you’ll get shots of tiny amounts of penicillin, with increasingly larger amounts until your immune system can handle the drug.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/children/duchenne-muscular-dystrophy,"Muscular dystrophies are a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common type. It’s caused by flaws in the gene that controls how the body keeps muscles healthy. The disease almost always affects boys, and symptoms usually begin early in childhood. Children with DMD have a hard time standing up, walking, and climbing stairs. Many eventually need wheelchairs to get around. They can also have heart and lung problems. Although there isn't a cure, the outlook for people with DMD is better than it has ever been. Years ago, children with the disease usually didn’t live beyond their teens. Today, they live well into their 30s, and sometimes into their 40s and 50s. There are therapies that can ease symptoms, and researchers are looking for new ones, as well.","If your child has DMD, you’ll probably notice the first signs before they turn 6 years old. Muscles in the legs are usually some of the first affected, so they’ll probably start to walk much later than other children their age. Once they can walk, they may fall down often and have trouble climbing stairs or getting up from the floor. After a few years, they might also begin to waddle or walk on their toes.DMD also can damage the heart, lungs, and other parts of the body. As they get older, your child might have other symptoms, including: The muscle problems can cause cramps at times, but in general, DMD isn’t painful. Your child will still have control of their bladder and bowels. Although some children with the disorder have learning and behavior problems, DMD doesn’t affect your child’s intelligence.","DMD is caused by a problem in one of your genes. Genes contain the information your body needs to make proteins, which carry out many different body functions.If you have DMD, the gene that makes a protein called dystrophin is broken. This protein normally keeps muscles strong and protects them from injury. The condition is more common in boys because of the way parents pass DMD genes to their children. It’s what scientists call a sex-linked disease because it’s connected to the groups of genes, called chromosomes, that determine if a baby is a boy or a girl. It’s rare, but sometimes people who don't have a family history of DMD get the disease when their genes get defects on their own.","You should let your child’s doctor know about the symptoms you’ve been noticing. They’ll want to know your child’s medical history, then ask questions about their symptoms, like:The doctor will give your child a physical exam, and they may do some tests to rule out other conditions that can cause muscle weakness. If the doctor suspects DMD, they’ll do some other tests, including:","There’s no cure for DMD, but there are medicines and other therapies that can ease your child’s symptoms, protect their muscles, and keep their heart and lungs healthy. Eteplirsen (Exondys 51)  has been approved to treat individuals with a specific mutation of the gene that leads to DMD. It is an injection medication. Its most common side effects are balance problems and vomiting. Although the drug increases dystrophin production, which would predict improvement in muscle function, this has not yet been shown. The oral corticosteroid deflazacort (Emflaza) was approved in 2017 to treat DMD, becoming the first FDA approval of any corticosteroid to treat the condition. Deflazacort has been found to help patients retain muscle strength as well as helping them maintain their ability to walk. Common side effects include puffiness, increased appetite and weight gain. Steroids such as prednisone slow muscle damage. Children who take this medicine are able to walk for 2 to 5 years longer than they would without it. The drugs also can help your child’s heart and lungs work better.Because DMD can cause heart problems, it's important for your child to see a heart doctor, called a cardiologist, for checkups once every 2 years until age 10, and once a year after that. Girls and women who carry the gene have a higher risk of heart problems, too. They should see a cardiologist in their late teens or early adult years to check for any problems. For the small number of DMD patients with the gene mutation exon 45 skipping, the injectable casimersen (Amondys 45) has been appropved. It is the first targeted treatment for this type of mutation and has been shown to help increase the production of dystophin."

Dupuytren's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/dupuytrens-disease-topic-overview,"Dupuytren's disease, also called Dupuytren’s contracture,  is an abnormal thickening and tightening of the normally loose and flexible tissue beneath the skin of the palm and fingers, called fascia. The pinkie and ring fingers are most often affected. Both hands are usually involved, although one may have worse symptoms than the other. The fascia contains strands of fibers, like cords, that run from the palm upward into the fingers. In Dupuytren's disease, these cords tighten, or contract, causing the fingers to curl forward. In severe cases, it can lead to crippling hand deformities.",The signs of Dupuytren’s disease show up in phases:,"All surgery comes with risks. Complications of surgery are rare but may include: A procedure called aponeurotomy is an alternative to traditional surgery for Dupuytren's contracture. Instead of an open cut, it uses the sharp end of a needle to cut the thick bands under the skin, which may help you recover faster. However, it doesn’t work as well for people with more serious cases. Overall, there is less risk of complications, but there is a risk of nerve, blood vessel, or tendon damage. Needle aponeurotomy is even more effective when used in combination with corticosteroid injections. A specialized hand surgeon must perform this procedure. Ask your doctor what type of surgery is best for you. Your doctor may recommend physical therapy after surgery.","Your health care provider will ask you questions about your symptoms as well as your overall health, your health history, and your family’s medical history. Then they’ll examine your hands, wrists, and fingers. Diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease typically involves feeling the palm areas to check for nodules and recording how many nodules are found. Your doctor will likely ask you to try to place your hands flat on a table. You may have tests to: Medical staff may also take pictures of your hand to document how it looks. These exams and tests will be repeated over time to determine if the condition is getting worse.","There is no cure for Dupuytren's disease. However, the condition isn’t life-threatening, and it may not cause discomfort for many years, if ever. Some people with the condition never need treatment, just monitoring.If it’s painful or interferes with a person's daily activities, there are treatment options, including medication and surgery. Finger splints don’t help people with Dupuytren's disease and may even cause harm. Stretching the finger forcefully can actually speed up the inward curling of the finger. Non-surgical treatment"
Dysania,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-dysania,"When you can’t get going in the morning every day, it can impact every aspect of your life. Your family, boss, co-workers, and friends might not understand why you can’t function. If you have dysania, it doesn’t mean you’re lazy. You could have underlying issues that are to blame for your extreme fatigue.","Treating your underlying condition will go a long way toward helping you resolve your issues with waking up. Whatever the cause, it will help to practice good sleep habits:Certain medicines or other therapies can also help you get a better night’s rest. It’s important to see your doctor if you think you have dysania, or any sleep problem, so you can get the help you need. Do you struggle when the alarm goes off every morning? If you have a really hard time, you could have something called dysania. This means you simply can’t get out of bed for about 1 to 2 hours after you wake up. Doctors don’t recognize it as a medical condition, as it is not an official diagnosis. But if you experience it, you know it can be a serious problem.","Without proper treatment, your condition could get worse. If you have depression, this can be dangerous because an untreated mental health disorder could make you more likely to harm yourself.  Low activity and too much sleep can also be bad for your health. The recommended amount of sleep for most adults is 6 to 8 hours per night. A 2014 study showed that people who slept longer than 10 hours a day were more likely to have psychiatric illnesses and a higher body mass index (BMI). In a 2018 paper published in the European Heart Journal, researchers found a link between sleeping more than the recommended amount and a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and death. Specifically, those who slept more than 10 hours a day had a 41% greater risk. ",,
Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding,https://www.webmd.com/women/abnormal-uterine-bleeding,"Abnormal uterine bleeding is when you bleed outside of your normal monthly period. You might hear it called anovulatory bleeding. Your flow could also be heavier or last longer than what’s typical. When it comes to menstrual cycles, there’s a wide range of “normal.” But your period shouldn’t be a problem for you month after month. If it’s so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated.","The signs of abnormal uterine bleeding include: Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding:If you could be pregnant or you’re past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy. That’s when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you’re having a miscarriage. After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out.","There are a few possible causes behind abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods.These things can throw off your hormones, too: Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus. Endometriosis can also cause abnormal bleeding. This is when tissue like the kind that lines the inside of your uterus grows outside of your uterus. Other health conditions. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can result from:","It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give the doctor specific information about your symptoms. They’ll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam. You’ll probably get a pregnancy test, and you may also have:","Your treatment will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding -- if a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you’re close to menopause, the doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try. They include: Sometimes surgery can be needed to stop the bleeding:"

Dysmyelogenic Leukodystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/brain/leukodystrophy-types,"The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought.

Eaton-Lambert Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-myasthenia-gravis-basics,"Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength.","The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication.","Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors.Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present.","To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include:","Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include:If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus. A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options:"

It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers.

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth.","Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers. Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder.

You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."

Ectopia Cordis,https://www.webmd.com/baby/ectopia-cordis-overview,"Experts don’t know exactly what causes ectopia cordis. But they have several theories. One is that as the baby develops during pregnancy, physical changes happen that limit its normal growth. For example, fibrous bands can appear on and restrict the amniotic sac, which surrounds the baby in the womb. Or the baby’s chest itself develops in an unusual way that stops the heart from moving down into its normal place, causing both ectopia cordis and other cardiac problems. Ectopia cordis is also commonly linked to defects in the sternum (breastbone), pericardium (membrane that covers the heart), and abdominal wall as well as to chromosomal conditions such as trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome.

Or the baby’s chest itself develops in an unusual way that stops the heart from moving down into its normal place, causing both ectopia cordis and other cardiac problems. Ectopia cordis is also commonly linked to defects in the sternum (breastbone), pericardium (membrane that covers the heart), and abdominal wall as well as to chromosomal conditions such as trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome. One recent theory is that some embryos lack a certain gene called BMP2, and that makes it harder for the heart to form and the front of the baby’s chest to develop. ","If your baby has ectopia cordis, you might find out after a routine ultrasound as early as in your pregnancy’s first trimester or the beginning of your second trimester. You might need to have another round of ultrasound to help with diagnosis. These results are key in helping you decide how to proceed.If you decide to continue with the pregnancy, your doctor will closely follow your baby’s development using a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography, a test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart.","To help protect the baby, you’ll need to give birth by a C-section. Your baby may need extra help to breathe. Doctors may insert a flexible plastic tube into their windpipe to keep air flowing, and they also may give the baby a special liquid through that tube that coats the lungs, making sure they can take in oxygen well. To treat ectopia cordis itself, the main goal of surgery is to close the open chest wall. The surgeon and health care team will also place the heart within the thorax and repair any other cardiac defects. Whether or not these surgeries can happen depends on the kind of ectopia cordis. Also, if the baby has intestines or abdominal organs outside of their body, the surgical team will insert these into the abdomen.Surgeries are often done in several steps. The first challenge is to fit the heart into a smaller-than-normal chest cavity. After your baby’s doctor does this, they will fix the sternum. Heart transplants aren’t usually an option. Other key things that affect treatment and outcomes are whether the heart is totally uncovered or if it’s covered by a serous membrane (the tissue that lines body cavities) or ordinary skin."
Ectopic Pregnancy,https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That’s because the egg can’t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus.  ","At first you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts. Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting, or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.",You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus. You’re more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control.,"Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.","Because a fertilized egg can’t survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don’t have serious health problems. They’ll use one of two methods: medication or surgery.Medication. If your fallopian tube hasn’t ruptured and your pregnancy isn’t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there’s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It’s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won’t be able to take methotrexate if you’re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don’t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You’ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG."

"Eczema, Atopic",https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/eczema/atopic-dermatitis-eczema,"Eczema is a group of conditions that make your skin inflamed or irritated. The most common type is atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema. “Atopic” refers to a person’s tendency to get allergic conditions such as asthma and hay fever. Eczema affects about 10% to 20% of infants and about 3% of adults and children in the U.S. Most children outgrow it by their 10th birthday. Some people continue to have symptoms on and off for life. There’s no cure, but most people can manage their symptoms by getting treatment and by avoiding irritants. Eczema isn’t contagious, so you can’t spread it to another person.","Eczema looks different for everyone. And your flare-ups won’t always happen in the same area. No matter which part of your skin is affected, eczema is almost always itchy. The itching sometimes starts before the rash. Your skin may also be:Symptoms in infants In infants, the itchy rash can lead to an oozing, crusting condition, mainly on the face and scalp. It can also happen on their arms, legs, back, and chest. Symptoms in children Children and teens usually have a rash in the bends of their elbows, behind their knees, on their neck, or on their wrists or ankles. The rash turns scaly and dry. Symptoms in adults The rash usually happens on your face, the backs of your knees, wrists, hands, or feet. Your skin will probably be very dry, thick, or scaly. In fair-skinned people, these areas may start out reddish and then turn brown. In darker-skinned people, eczema can affect skin pigments, making the affected area lighter or darker. When to see your doctor Call your doctor if:",Experts aren’t sure what exactly causes eczema. Things that may make it more likely include:,"No one test can spot eczema. Your doctor will probably diagnose it by looking at your skin and by asking a few questions. Because many people with eczema also have allergies, your doctor may order some allergy tests to look for irritants or triggers. Children with eczema are especially likely to have allergy tests. If your doctor diagnoses you with eczema, you might want to ask them:","The aim of eczema treatment is easing and preventing itching, which can lead to infection. Home remedies Some things you can do at home may help ease symptoms. Moisturizers. Because your skin is dry and itchy, your doctor will recommend lotions and creams to keep it moist. Creams and ointments ease inflammation and put water back in your skin to help it heal. Put them on several times a day, including right after you bathe or shower. Petroleum jelly and mineral oil work well because they form a thick barrier over your skin.Products with glycerin, lactic acid, and urea may also help because they help pull water into your skin. You’ll use these when your skin is damp, such as after bathing, to help hold in moisture. Hydrocortisone creams and antihistamines. Over-the-counter products like hydrocortisone cream and antihistamines can also help. Hydrocortisone is a steroid that helps keep redness, itching, and swelling at bay. You can buy low-strength creams and lotions at the store. If those don’t help, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. It’s safe to put hydrocortisone on most body parts as many as four times a day for up to 7 days, as long as you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding. Keep it away from your eyes, rectum, and genitals. Some people have a severe reaction to hydrocortisone. If you have trouble breathing or swallowing, or notice a skin rash after you use it, call 911 or your doctor. Over-the-counter allergy meds may not work well for itchy skin caused by eczema. But antihistamines that are known to cause drowsiness can help you sleep if you take them before bed."

"Edema, Idiopathic",https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/edema-overview,"Peripheral edema. This usually affects the legs, feet, and ankles, but it can also happen in the arms. It could be a sign of problems with your circulatory system, lymph nodes, or kidneys. Pedal edema. This happens when fluid gathers in your feet and lower legs. It’s more common if you’re older or pregnant. It can make it harder to move around in part because you may not have as much feeling in your feet. Lymphedema. This swelling in the arms and legs is most often caused by damage to your lymph nodes, tissues that help filter germs and waste from your body. The damage may be the result of cancer treatments like surgery and radiation. The cancer itself can also block lymph nodes and lead to fluid buildup.Pulmonary edema. When fluid collects in the air sacs in your lungs, you have pulmonary edema. That makes it hard for you to breathe, and it’s worse when you lie down. You may have a fast heartbeat, feel suffocated, and cough up a foamy spittle, sometimes with blood. If it happens suddenly, call 911. Cerebral edema. This is a very serious condition in which fluid builds up in the brain. It can happen if you hit your head hard, if a blood vessel gets blocked or bursts, or you have a tumor or allergic reaction. Macular edema. This happens when fluid builds up in a part of your eye called the macula, which is in the center of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It happens when damaged blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the area.","Your symptoms will depend on the amount of swelling you have and where you have it. Edema in a small area from an infection or inflammation (like a mosquito bite) may cause no symptoms. On the other hand, a large allergic reaction (such as from a bee sting) may cause edema on your entire arm that can bring pain and limit your arm's movement. Food allergies and allergic reactions to medicine may cause tongue or throat edema. This can be life-threatening if it interferes with your breathing. Leg edema can make the legs feel heavy. This can affect walking. In edema and heart disease, for example, the legs may easily weigh an extra 5 or 10 pounds each. Severe leg edema can interfere with blood flow, leading to ulcers on the skin. Pulmonary edema causes shortness of breath and sometimes low oxygen levels in the blood. Some people with pulmonary edema may have a cough. There may be an indent or a “pit” that remains for a while after you push on the skin in some types of edema. This is called pitting edema. If the tissue springs back to its normal shape, it’s called non-pitting edema. It’s a symptom that may help your doctor figure out the cause of your edema.","Things like a twisted ankle, a bee sting, or a skin infection will cause edema. In some cases, like an infection, this may be helpful. More fluid from your blood vessels puts more infection-fighting white blood cells in the swollen area.Edema can also come from other conditions or from when the balance of substances in your blood is off. For example: Low albumin. Your doctor may call this hypoalbuminemia. Albumin and other proteins in the blood act like sponges to keep fluid in your blood vessels. Low albumin may contribute to edema, but it’s not usually the only cause. Allergic reactions. Edema is a part of most allergic reactions. In response to the allergen, nearby blood vessels leak fluid into the affected area. Obstruction of flow. If drainage of fluid from a part of your body is blocked, fluid can back up. A blood clot in the deep veins of your leg can cause leg edema. A tumor blocking the flow of blood or another fluid called lymph can cause edema. Critical illness.Burns, life-threatening infections, or other critical illnesses can cause a reaction that allows fluid to leak into tissues almost everywhere. This can cause edema all over your body.",,"To treat edema, you often must treat its underlying cause. For example, you might take allergy medications to treat swelling from allergies. Edema from a block in fluid drainage can sometimes be treated by getting the drainage flowing again. A blood clot in the leg is treated with blood thinners. They break down the clot and get drainage back to normal. A tumor that blocks blood or lymph can sometimes be shrunk or removed with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Leg edema related to congestive heart failure or liver disease can be treated with a diuretic (sometimes called a ''water pill'') like furosemide (Lasix). When you can pee more, fluid from the legs can flow back into the blood. Limiting how much sodium you eat can also help.""Edema"" is the medical term for swelling. Body parts swell from injury or inflammation. It can affect a small area or the entire body. Medications, pregnancy, infections, and many other medical problems can cause edema. Edema happens when your small blood vessels leak fluid into nearby tissues. That extra fluid builds up, which makes the tissue swell. It can happen almost anywhere in the body."
EDMD,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve:"

Eisenmenger Complex,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/eisenmenger-syndrome,"Your heart has four chambers -- a left and right atrium and a left and right ventricle. As your heart beats, blood travels from the body into the right atrium, which sends it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. When that oxygen-carrying blood goes back to the heart, the left atrium takes it in and passes it to the left ventricle, which sends it out to your body. But in people with Eisenmenger syndrome, there’s often a hole between chambers – usually between the left and right ventricle. When that happens:If that defect isn’t found and corrected early, it can result in more problems, like high blood pressure in your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) and heart failure.

They can live there for years and cause a lot of damage to your lymph system. This is what causes the swelling.","Your doctor can find out if you have elephantiasis by giving you a physical exam. They will ask about your medical history, and whether you’ve traveled to a place where you were more likely to have gotten elephantiasis. They also will have blood tests done to see if roundworms are in your bloodstream. These tests need to be done at night, because that’s when these parasites are active.","There are medicines to treat elephantiasis. Your doctor may give you one called diethylcarbamazine (DEC). You’ll take it once a year. It will kill the microscopic worms in your bloodstream. Another way to treat elephantiasis is to use DEC in combination with a medicine called ivermectin. This is also taken once a year, and the combination has shown better long-term results.If you have elephantiasis symptoms, there are some things you can do on your own to ease them: You may also be able to wrap the affected areas tightly to prevent them from getting worse, but you should check with your doctor before doing this.

But as the disease gets worse, you might notice these common signs of COPD:","Long-term exposure to things that irritate your lungs is the most common cause. In the U.S., that’s cigarette, pipe, or other types of tobacco smoke. If you hang around other smokers and breathe in a lot of secondhand smoke, that can play a role, too. Your odds also go up if you smoke and have asthma. If you smoke and have COPD, it tends to get worse faster. You might also develop this condition if you’ve been exposed to things like dust, air pollution, or certain chemicals for long periods of time. Your age can make COPD more likely. It develops slowly over the years, so most people are at least 40 when symptoms begin. It’s rare, but your genes could put you at risk for COPD. If you lack a protein called alpha 1 antitrypsin (AAT), you may be more likely to get it.","Your doctor will ask about your symptoms, your medical history, and whether you smoke or have been exposed to chemicals, dust, or smoke at work. They’ll also do a physical exam and breathing tests. Let them know if you have an ongoing cough. The most common test is called spirometry. You’ll breathe into a large, flexible tube that’s connected to a machine called a spirometer. It’ll measure how much air your lungs can hold and how fast you can blow air out of them. Your doctor may order other tests to rule out other lung problems, such as asthma or heart failure. These might include:","You can improve life with COPD by taking part in the management of your condition. One way to help your doctor is to monitor your COPD symptoms, diet, and exercise daily. Keeping a daily written log may help you recognize a COPD exacerbation when it begins. With a log, you’re more likely to notice when COPD symptoms suddenly get worse. This may allow you to seek medical treatment early, when it’s most effective, and might keep you from having to go to the hospital. It is also important to follow a healthy, balanced diet to prevent being overweight, which can make shortness of breath worse, or underweight, which is linked to a poorer outcome.

If you do have symptoms, your doctor may offer: Within your skull, there’s a small, bony nook at the base of your brain that holds and protects your pituitary gland (which controls how hormones work in your body). This tiny structure is called the sella turcica. In a small number of people, the sella turcica is shaped in such a way that spinal fluid can leak into it. The buildup of spinal fluid squashes the pituitary gland flat, so it looks like your sella turcica is empty. This condition is known as primary empty sella syndrome (ESS) and can also be seen in pseudotumor cerebrii. Your pituitary gland also can be flattened or small because you’ve had surgery or radiation for a tumor or a serious head injury. This is called secondary ESS.

Epididymal Cyst,https://www.webmd.com/men/spermatocele-or-epididemal-cysts,"A spermatocele (also called a spermatic or epididymal cyst) is a fluid-filled sac that grows in the epididymis -- a tightly coiled tube about 20 feet long where the sperm matures as it passes through. It's in the scrotum and surrounds the back and top of the testicle. Spermatoceles vary in size. They typically don’t hurt, but they could cause pain if they grow too large. Spermatoceles can be smooth. They might also be filled with a whitish, cloudy fluid. Sometimes, they hold sperm. Most of the time, they’re benign (not cancerous). Still, if you notice a growth near or in your penis or scrotum (the pouch that holds your testicles), see your doctor to have it checked. Spermatoceles don’t impact fertility.",,"Spermatoceles often contain pools of dead sperm. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this. Often, spermatoceles develop for no specific reason at all. Sometimes they might happen when one of the tubes that transport and store sperm gets blocked.Spermatocele risk factors Spermatoceles are actually quite common. About 3 out of 10 men will get them at some point in their lives. Men ages 20-50 are most likely to get them. They don’t have many known risk factors. Men whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol in pregnancy might get them more.

Your doctor might find it during an exam. As the cyst gets bigger, you may feel heaviness in your testicle. You might also notice a mass or swelling behind or above your testicle. Your doctor will likely do a couple of tests to make sure the growth is a spermatocele and not a tumor. They’ll probably start with a physical exam. You’ll also have a transillumination or an ultrasound.Transillumination is where your doctor shines a light through your scrotum. If the growth is a spermatocele, the light will shine through it. If it’s a mass, it won't. Ultrasound is the next step if transillumination doesn’t show fluid. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images on a screen.","Most of the time, they’re not treated. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers to make you more comfortable. Aspiration is a procedure that can help relieve some of the pain and pressure of spermatoceles. Your doctor will insert a needle into the cyst to remove some of the fluid. If the cyst refills and comes back, your doctor can do a procedure called a sclerotherapy. Your doctor will drain some of the fluid from the spermatocele. Then they’ll use a substance that causes the sac to fill with scar tissue. This tissue could lower the risk of the spermatocele coming back. But it can damage the epididymis. Your doctor may suggest this option only if you’re not interested in having children. In rare cases (if the spermatocele is getting in the way of your daily life), your doctor could remove it through surgery.

The epididymis carries sperm from the testes, which produce it, to the vas deferens, a tube behind the bladder. The epididymis lies in coils around the back of a man’s testicle and can be nearly 20 feet long. It can take nearly 2 weeks for sperm to make it from one end of the epididymis to the other. In that time, the sperm cells mature to the point where they’re able to fertilize a woman’s egg cell.","When a bacterial infection strikes, the epididymis gradually becomes swollen and painful.

They include:","The most common treatment for epididymitis is antibiotics. If your doctor believes you have epididymitis, they might give you a prescription for antibiotics before any lab test results are even back.You’ll likely take those medications for a week or two, and you’ll usually start feeling better in a matter of days. Always take your full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even when you feel better. Even after your antibiotics take effect, some swelling may last for weeks or months, and you may still be sore during that time. You can reduce the pain and swelling by taking over-the-counter pain relievers, applying a cold compress, or elevating your scrotum (you might wear supportive underwear, like a jockstrap)."
Epilepsy and Seizures,https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/guide/first-aid-seizures,"The type of seizure most people will think of is the generalized tonic-clonic seizure, better known as a grand mal seizure. They're frightening to watch, and someone who has one rarely knows or remembers what's happening. These seizures follow a pattern:Any generalized seizure can be dangerous because the person is unaware of their surroundings and can't protect themselves from harm. The uncontrolled thrashing raises their chances of getting hurt. Focal seizures are different. They're less intense and usually last no more than a minute or two. Part of their body, like an arm, might get stiff or go floppy. You may see repeated, rhythmic, or jerking movements in one place or that spread to different body parts. The person could zone out or stare at nothing. They may or may not realize what's happening but can't control it. When it's over, they won't remember a thing.",,,,"There are medicines and treatments which can and should be used in specific situations. Referred to as “rescue medications,” they do not take the place of daily medications and should only be used to help stop a seizure quickly in emergency situations.

Episodic Ataxia,https://www.webmd.com/brain/ataxia-types-brain-and-nervous-system,"Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain. When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don’t want them to. The word ataxia actually means “without coordination.”  Ataxia isn’t a disorder or a disease itself -- it’s a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect.",,"Around 150,000 people in the U.S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include:You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications, from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy, or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes.",,"The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily. Learn more about qualifying for disability for ataxia."

They might find signs that you have mono, such as an enlarged spleen, an organ in your belly that filters blood. Your doctor will also check to see if you have a swollen liver and white patches on your tonsils. You may also need to get some blood tests. One test looks for antibodies, substances your immune system makes in response to the EBV virus. Another test looks for a type of white blood cell your body uses to fight off the EBV infection.","Like other viruses, Epstein-Barr can't be treated with antibiotics.

Erythema Infectiosum (Fifth Disease),https://www.webmd.com/children/guide/understanding-fifth-disease-basics,"  Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral infection common among school-age children. It’s most common during winter and spring. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses. The others include rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum.","The most recognized symptom of fifth disease is a sudden, bright red rash across the cheeks that looks as if the child has been slapped. You might also hear it called slapped-cheek disease. The disease is rare in infants and adults.  The rash typically appears a week to 10 days after symptoms similar to those of the common cold, such as: ",Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This parvovirus only infects humans. Other forms of the virus can infect dogs and cats.,"A doctor can often diagnose fifth disease by looking at the rash. They might do a blood test to check for antibodies to the virus that causes the disease. This test isn’t routine. It’s usually only done in certain situations, for example, if you’re pregnant.   ",The goal of fifth disease treatment is to ease symptoms and make you or your child more comfortable. There’s no specific medicine to treat the virus that causes fifth disease. Your doctor might suggest:

Ewing's Family of Tumors,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/ewings-sarcoma,"The kind of Ewing’s sarcoma you might have can be seen where the tumor forms. The pelvis is where it most often starts, followed by the femur (or thigh bone). Regardless of where it starts, it can spread to other bones, bone marrow, and even vital organs such as the lungs, heart, and kidneys. Some types are: Bone tumor: 87% of Ewing’s sarcoma happens in the bone, often appearing in the thigh bones, pelvis, ribs, or shoulder blades. But the tumor can appear in any bone.Soft tissue (extra-osseous) tumor: This type of tumor affects the soft tissues around your bones, such as cartilage or muscle. It’s rarely found in the soft tissue of the arms, legs, head, neck, chest, and abdomen. Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET): This type of tumor is found in the nerves and can be detected in many parts of the body. Askin tumor: This is a type of pPNET tumor that’s found in the chest.","When you have Ewing’s, you may feel pain, swelling, or stiffness in the area of the tumor (arms, legs, chest, back, or pelvis) for weeks or months. This could get mistaken for bumps and bruises. In children, you might mistake it for sports injuries. Other symptoms include: ● A lump near skin that feels warm and soft to the touch ● Constant low fever ● Limping because your legs hurt ● Bone pain that gets worse when you exercise or during the night ● Broken bones without an obvious cause ● Weight loss ● Always being tired ● Paralysis or loss of bladder control if the tumor is near your spine When you see symptoms, you should contact your doctor so they can do a diagnosis. As with many types of cancer, the earlier you have it detected and treated, the better.","It’s unclear what causes Ewing’s sarcoma, as it doesn’t appear to run in families. So far, research suggests that it’s not related to exposure to radiation, chemicals, or other outside things in the environment. It appears that the cell DNA changes after birth, leading to Ewing’s sarcoma. Why that happens remains unknown. One possibility is that it could be a second cancer in people who’ve been treated with radiation for another type of cancer.","Your doctor has a number of tests to see whether you have Ewing’s sarcoma. If you do, they will also try to find out whether the tumor has spread and to what extent. This is known as staging.Physical exam: Your doctor will start out with this, especially checking around the painful areas for signs such as lumps, redness, and swelling. X-rays: These take an image of a certain area of your body where a tumor is suspected. If the X-rays show any problems, your doctor may order other imaging tests. Bone scan: This is used to find out whether cancer cells are in your bones. A small amount of radioactive dye is injected into one of your veins. The dye will collect in the bones that have tumors. When you lie beneath a bone scanner, the doctor will be able to detect where the radioactive dye has gathered. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): For this test, you lie flat and still on a surface that slides you inside the tube-shaped MRI machine. It uses magnetic field and radio waves to create a detailed, 3-D image inside your body. Computed tomography scan(CAT/CT scan): Like you would do for an MRI, you lie flat inside a CT scanner, which takes X-ray pictures while linked to a computer. The MRI is generally preferred over the CT scan.","What kind of treatment you get will depend on several things. They include:Treatment options include: Chemotherapy: This is usually the first step. With this option, medicines are used to kill cancer cells and stop them from growing. They can be injected into your bloodstream. Your doctor may use more than one type of chemotherapy at a time or combine this with surgery and radiation. Surgery: Your doctor will try to remove the tumor to stop its spread. In some cases, they may have to amputate an arm or leg if the tumor has spread a lot. Radiation: In this therapy, a technician will use X-rays and other types of radiation to kill the cancer cells. This can be done using machines outside the body to deliver the dose, or through needles and tubes sent right to the tumor. If the treatment works, you will still need to follow up with your doctor for many years. Ewing’s sarcoma can return even a decade after the diagnosis. Children with Ewing’s sarcoma that hasn’t spread have cure rates as high as 80%. It’s much lower in cases where the tumor has spread. It’s important to see a doctor right away if you see symptoms in your child.Ewing’s sarcoma is a very rare type of cancerous tumor that grows in your bones or the soft tissue around your bones, such as cartilage or the nerves. It usually affects people from the ages of 10 to 20 and has a high rate of being cured. Ewing’s sarcoma affects about 200 children and young adults every year in the United States and shows up slightly more often in males. While adults can get Ewing’s sarcoma, it is uncommon. It mostly affects white people and has rarely been found in African Americans or Asian Americans."

Aerobic exercise should be performed at a comfortable, steady pace that allows you to talk normally and easily during the activity. Ask your therapist what intensity of exercise is appropriate for your fitness level. During exercise, your heart's ""training range,"" or target heart rate, should be closely monitored. To improve your body's aerobic condition, you should calculate your maximum heart rate -- 220 minus your age -- and exercise at a level of intensity between 60% and 80% of your maximum heart rate. Examples of aerobic activities include walking, swimming, low-impact aerobic dance, skiing, and biking, and may even include such daily activities as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, or playing golf. Walking is one of the easiest aerobic exercises to begin because it requires no special skills or equipment other than a good pair of supportive walking shoes, and it's less stressful on joints than running or jogging.",,,,"A tailored program that includes a balance of three types of exercises -- range-of-motion, strengthening, and endurance -- can relieve the symptoms of arthritis and protect joints from further damage.

Expanded Rubella Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-rubella,"  Rubella is a contagious disease that mostly affects children. It causes symptoms like a rash, fever, and eye redness. It’s usually mild in kids, but it can be serious in pregnant women. You may also hear rubella called the “German measles” or the “three-day measles.” The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.","Rubella is usually mild in children. Sometimes it doesn't cause any symptoms. A pink or red-spotted rash is often the first sign of infection. It starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash lasts about 3 days. This is why rubella is sometimes called the ""3-day measles."" Along with the rash, you or your child might have:","Until the 1960s, rubella was a common childhood infection. Thanks to the MMR vaccine, the virus stopped spreading in the United States around 2004. Yet it still spreads in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. People from these areas sometimes bring the rubella virus to the United States when they travel. Anyone can catch rubella if they're exposed to the virus and haven't been vaccinated. Pregnant women face serious risks because rubella can cause serious complications to the baby during pregnancy.","If your doctor thinks you have rubella, you may get blood tests and a virus culture to confirm that.

Extrauterine Pregnancy,https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That’s because the egg can’t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus.  ","At first you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts. Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting, or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.",You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus. You’re more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control.,"Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.","Because a fertilized egg can’t survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don’t have serious health problems. They’ll use one of two methods: medication or surgery.Medication. If your fallopian tube hasn’t ruptured and your pregnancy isn’t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there’s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It’s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won’t be able to take methotrexate if you’re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don’t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You’ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG."
Eye Retraction Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/duane-syndrome-facts,There are three types of DS:,Signs of DS can include: Some people with DS also have double vision and headaches. You might also have neck pain as a result of tilting our head.,"DS can be passed down in families, but this is rare. Ninety percent of the people who have it are the only ones in their family with it. Experts believe something happens to cause DS between the third and eighth week of pregnancy. This is when a baby's eye nerves and muscles start to develop. There's probably more than one factor involved, like problems with certain genes or the mother being exposed to something in the environment. But it isn't clear what actually causes DS.","Because DS has clear symptoms, most people are diagnosed before age 10. The exam usually includes a close look at your eye along with a vision test and measurements of how far your eye can move. The doctor also may want to do a hearing test and examine your spine, the roof of your mouth, and your hands. A gene called CHN1 is linked to some cases of DS. A genetic test can look for changes, or mutations, in the gene that might be passed on to other family members. This is done with a blood test.","There's no cure for DS. But your doctor can do things to help your eyes line up when you're looking straight ahead and to protect your vision. Prescription glasses or contact lenses can also help. Your doctor might recommend that you wear a patch over the eye you see best with to help avoid lazy eye, or amblyopia. This forces your weaker eye to get stronger. Your doctor may also prescribe special lenses for glasses that shift your vision so you can hold your head in a more natural way.It's important to have regular eye exams -- young children may need to see their doctor every 3 to 6 months so a lazy eye can be treated right away. In severe cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to help other muscles in your eye make up for the ones that are affected. This won't give you normal eye motion, but it usually reduces the head turning.Duane syndrome (DS) is a rare eye disorder some people are born with. The muscles and nerves around your eye don't work well together, and that keeps it from moving as it should. The disorder is also known as Duane's syndrome, Duane retraction syndrome, or Stilling-Turk syndrome. It happens when the nerves that control the eye muscles don't grow normally during pregnancy or are missing. As a result, some muscles stretch when they should tighten or stay loose when they need to squeeze. DS doesn't cause blindness and doesn't usually lead to other health issues. In very rare cases, it has been linked to problems with bones, eyes, ears, kidneys, and the nervous system. Most of the time, only one eye is affected -- usually the left one. But 20% of people have trouble with both eyes. Women are slightly more likely to have DS than men."

Yet females that have the gene for Fabry,  or carriers of the gene, can also have symptoms of Fabry that show up differently. Women with the disease have a significant risk of serious complications from Fabry, as well as organ damage, and should be seen regularly by their doctor or health care provider Problems can include:  ","You get Fabry disease from your parents. It's passed down through genes. The problem is that your body can't make an enzyme called alpha-galactosidase A, which you need to break down fatty substances like oils, waxes, and fatty acids. When you have Fabry disease, you either were born without that enzyme or it doesn’t work right.","It can take a long time to get diagnosed with Fabry disease. That's because the symptoms of Fabry are common to many illnesses and can affect so many different parts of the body.Many people who have Fabry disease don't get diagnosed until years after they first have symptoms. They’ve often seen several different doctors for various symptoms and sometimes get the wrong diagnosis. If your family history suggests you could be at risk for Fabry disease, you may want to ask your doctor about getting genetic testing. When you see the doctor, they’ll do a physical exam and ask you questions like: If your doctor thinks it might be Fabry disease, they’ll ask you to either take a blood test so they can measure the level of alpha-galactosidase A, or take a DNA test.","There are two drug treatments. The most common is enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). These are given as infusions and replaces the enzyme that’s missing or isn’t working correctly. This allows your body to break down fatty acid substances the way it should. It’ll also help ease the pain and other symptoms that Fabry disease causes. You will probably visit an outpatient center every few weeks to get the enzyme injected into a vein.A newer option is the oral medication migalastat (Galafold). It differs from ERT in that it works to stabilize the enzymes that aren’t working. This also helps ease the effects of the disease on your organs. Because this disease affects the entire body and can damage many organs, your doctor may also recommend: You may need dialysis or a kidney transplant if Fabry disease has caused serious kidney damage. You can also expect to get regular tests to keep track of how you're doing. These may include:  "

In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans.

In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination.

Factitious Disorder by Proxy,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/munchausen-by-proxy,"In general, MSP is a very difficult disorder to treat and often requires years of therapy and support. In addition, MSP is considered a form of child abuse, which is a criminal offense.","Certain characteristics are common in a person with MSP, including: Other possible warning signs of MSP include:","The exact cause of MSP is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in its development. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or the early loss of a parent may be factors in its development. Some evidence suggests that major stress, such as marital problems, can trigger MSP.",,"The first concern in MSP is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims. This may require that the child be placed in the care of another. In fact, managing a case involving MSP often requires a team that includes a social worker, foster care organizations, and law enforcement, as well as doctors. Successful treatment of people with MSP is difficult because those with the disorder often deny there is a problem. In addition, treatment success is dependent on the person telling the truth, and people with MSP tend to be such accomplished liars that they begin to have trouble telling fact from fiction. Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) generally focuses on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). The goal of therapy for MSP is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill."

Fainting,https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-fainting-basics,"Fainting, also called syncope (pronounced SIN-ko-pee), is a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and posture caused by decreased blood flow to the brain.   Many different conditions can cause fainting. These include heart problems such as irregular heart beats, seizures, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), anemia (a deficiency in healthy oxygen carrying cells), and problems with how the nervous system (the body's system of nerves) regulates blood pressure. Some types of fainting seem to run in families.   While fainting may indicate a particular medical condition, sometimes it may occur in an otherwise healthy individual. Fainting is a particular problem for the elderly who may suffer serious injuries from falls when they faint. Most episodes are very brief. In most cases, the individual who has fainted regains complete consciousness within just a few minutes.   Fainting is a common problem, accounting for 3% of emergency room visits and 6% of hospital admissions. It can happen in otherwise healthy people. A person may feel faint and lightheaded (presyncope) or lose consciousness (syncope).",,"Fainting may have a variety of causes. A simple episode, also called a vasovagal attack or neurally-mediated syncope, is the most common type of fainting spell. It is most common in children and young adults. A vasovagal attack happens because blood pressure drops, reducing circulation to the brain and causing loss of consciousness. Typically an attack occurs while standing and is frequently preceded by a sensation of warmth, nausea, lightheadedness and visual ""grayout."" If the syncope is prolonged, it can trigger a seizure.   You may suffer from a simple fainting spell due to anxiety, fear, pain, intense emotional stress, hunger, or use of alcohol or drugs. Most people who suffer from simple fainting have no underlying heart or neurological (nerve or brain) problem.   Some people have a problem with the way their body regulates their blood pressure, particularly when they move too quickly from a lying or sitting position to a standing position. This condition is called postural hypotension and may be severe enough to cause fainting. This type of fainting is more common in the elderly, people who recently had a lengthy illness that kept them in bed and people who have poor muscle tone.  The following can cause fainting, too:  ",,

Infants with this abnormality develop signs of the condition very early in life.","Most infants with tetralogy of Fallot develop cyanosis in the first year of life. The following symptoms suggest tetralogy of Fallot: Episodes of extreme blue coloring (called hypercyanosis or simply ""tet spells"") occur in many children, usually in the first 2-3 years of life.","Tetralogy of Fallot occurs during development of the fetus, before birth, and is therefore termed a congenital birth defect. An error occurs as the fetal heart separates into the chambers, valves, and other structures that make up the normal human heart. No one is really sure why this occurs.","Even if the bluish color and other symptoms have resolved by the time the child gets medical attention, the health care provider will immediately suspect a heart problem. Medical tests will focus on identifying the cause of the cyanosis.","If your child starts to turn blue, place the child on their back in the knee-to-chest position and call 911 or your local emergency number.

These include: A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.","Your treatment will depend on:Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery.

Familial Emphysema,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency-rare,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it’s passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight.You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you’ll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through.","You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get it between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also could start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe.You may also get a lot of lung infections. Other warning signs include: If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you could have symptoms like: A newborn baby might have: It’s rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency runs in families. If you have it, you got it from faulty genes that both your parents passed down to you. Some people get the genes but don't have any symptoms. Or they have a mild version of the disease. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. That buildup in your liver causes liver disease. The shortage of AAT protein in your bloodstream leads to lung disease.","Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. You need to get blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also tests your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage.","Although there’s no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. Doctors call this augmentation therapy. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. Augmentation therapy is also called replacement therapy. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You get the treatment once a week. The replacement alpha-1 gets into your body through an IV. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. The goal of augmentation therapy is to slow or stop the damage in your lungs. It won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You’ll need these treatments for the rest of your life. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. Doctors call this a bronchodilator, meaning that it opens your airways. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece.

When you have it, too much of a waste product called bilirubin builds up in your blood. It can make your skin and eyes look yellow from time to time. Gilbert’s syndrome looks scarier than it is. It's a harmless condition that doesn't need to be treated.","Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't have symptoms. They have enough of the liver enzyme to control their bilirubin levels.When bilirubin does build up in the blood, it causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice. See your doctor if you notice a yellow color to your skin and eyes because another condition could be causing it. Jaundice can cause other symptoms such as: Jaundice is a common problem in babies. But it’s worse in babies born with Gilbert’s syndrome. Certain things can make your bilirubin levels rise, but you might only notice jaundice when you:","It happens when a gene called UGT1A1 changes, or mutates. This gene carries instructions for making a liver enzyme that helps break down and get rid of the bilirubin in your body. Parents pass UGT1A1 gene mutations to their children. You need two copies of the mutated gene -- one from each parent -- to get it. Even if you do have both genes, you might not have Gilbert’s syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome is more common in men than in women.","Although people are born with Gilbert’s syndrome, sometimes they don’t get diagnosed until their 20s or 30s. You may have a blood test for another reason and your doctor may notice you have high bilirubin levels, which may be a clue that you have the syndrome.They may do more tests to diagnose you, including: ","Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't need treatment. Jaundice doesn't cause any long-term problems. To prevent it, try to avoid things that make your bilirubin levels rise. For instance: The same liver enzyme that breaks down bilirubin also breaks down certain medicines, including: If you have Gilbert’s syndrome and you take any of these drugs, you're at higher risk for side effects like diarrhea. Ask your doctor before you take any new medicine. And don't take more than the recommended dose."

Familial Multiple Polyposis,https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/guide/inherited-colorectal-cancer,"Genes are tiny segments of DNA that control how cells function, such as telling them when to divide and grow. One copy of each gene comes from your mother; the other comes from your father. In 1991, researchers identified the gene called APC that is responsible for the condition. It can be found in 82% of patients with FAP. The lifetime risk of colon cancer in people who have this gene change is close to 100%.",,,"Blood tests can find the gene changes that make some people more likely to get FAP or HNPCC. You might want to consider genetic counseling and testing if:If you test positive for these gene changes, your doctor will probably recommend that you get a colonoscopy every year. This is a test that checks your colon for cancer or polyps. If you’ve already had colon cancer or polyps, your doctor may talk to you about a colectomy, which is surgery to remove your colon. Your relatives might want to consider genetic counseling and testing, too.",
Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension,https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help your symptoms so you can live better with the disease. It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure. With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Eventually, it can lead to heart failure.  ",You may not notice any symptoms for a while. The main one is shortness of breath when you're active. It usually starts slowly and gets worse as time goes on. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include:,"Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs:","If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, they will ask you about your medical history. They may also ask you:Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram: This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. CT scan: This can show enlarged pulmonary arteries. A CT scan can also spot other problems in the lungs that could cause shortness of breath.","Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. Ask your doctor what your options are and what to expect. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension.Most people also get treatment to improve their breathing, which makes it easier to be active and do daily tasks. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you’re short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. It helps you live longer when you have pulmonary hypertension. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners. Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren’t enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. A surgeon creates an opening between the right and left sides of the heart. This surgery can have serious side effects."
Fibrinoid Leukodystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/brain/leukodystrophy-types,"The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.","The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath.

Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it. If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy.","Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including:  ","There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition. In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy.Leukodystrophy isn’t just one disease; it’s actually a group of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds. Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine."

It’s actually part of normal growth that some soft tissue turns into bone. But with this problem in your gene, bone grows too often and too much. In most cases, you don’t get FOP -- which is also known as myositis ossificans progressive -- from your parents. That happens sometimes, but more often, there’s a change in your genes during your lifetime that causes it.","One of the telltale signs is present at birth -- the big toe on each foot is shorter than it should be and is turned toward the other toes. About half the people with FOP also have a similar issue with their thumbs. The other main sign is bone replacing soft tissue. This usually starts with tumorlike growths on the back, neck, and shoulders. The growths are painful and soon turn into bone. These flare-ups repeat throughout your life and spread to the rest of your body. It’s not always the case, but very often, an injury or virus triggers a flare-up. This makes it especially hard for people to get any kind of surgery or even an injection before getting a cavity filled. FOP flare-ups typically last 6 to 8 weeks. They may cause pain and swelling, stiffness in the joints, all-around discomfort, and a low-grade fever.","A glitch in one of the genes that tells your body how to grow your bones and muscles causes the condition.

Fibroids,https://www.webmd.com/women/uterine-fibroids/uterine-fibroids,"Uterine fibroids, which your doctor may call leiomyomas or myomas, are muscular tumors that can grow on your uterus. They rarely turn into cancer, and if you get them it doesn’t mean you’re more likely to get uterine cancer. Fibroids can vary a lot in size, shape, and location. They can show up in your uterus, uterine wall, or on its surface. They can also attach to your uterus by a stalk- or stem-like structure. Some are so small that your doctor can’t even see them with the naked eye. Others grow in big masses that can affect the size and shape of your uterus. Uterine fibroids usually appear in women of childbearing age -- generally between 30-40 years old, but they can show up at any age. They’re more common in African-American women than in white women, and they also tend to show up earlier and grow quicker in African-American women. Doctors don’t know why that is.","Fibroids may cause very mild symptoms, no symptoms at all, or symptoms that are severe. The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include:","A few things can raise your chances of developing uterine fibroids, such as: You’re more likely to get fibroids if your mom or sister has had them.","Your doctor may suspect you have uterine fibroids just from feeling your uterus during a routine pelvic exam. If the shape of your uterus feels irregular or unusually large, they may order further tests, such as:","There are many ways to treat fibroids. The treatment that works best for you will depend on whether you’re having symptoms, want to get pregnant, your age, and where your fibroids are. Watchful waiting. If you have only mild symptoms -- or no symptoms -- your doctor may suggest you simply wait and see. Fibroids aren’t cancerous, and they may grow slowly or not at all. They also may shrink or go away after menopause. Medications. Medications for fibroids treat your symptoms. Fibroids won’t go away but might shrink with some medications. They can also help with symptoms like pain and bleeding.  Oral birth control can reduce bleeding. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help ease pain. Vitamins and iron supplements can help with energy if you’re bleeding heavily and have anemia as a result. Other medications include: Surgery. If you have moderate or severe symptoms, you may need surgery for relief. Options include:"
Fibrosing Cholangitis,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-facts,"PSC develops slowly. You may have it for years before you notice any symptoms.

You may have it for years before you notice any symptoms. Some of the signs are: As PSC worsens, your bile ducts may become infected. This can lead to fever, chills, and pain in your belly.","Doctors aren't sure what causes PSC. It may be a virus, bacteria, genes, or problems with your immune system. It's linked to inflammatory bowel disease, primarily ulcerative colitis and, less often, Crohn's disease. About 75% of people with PSC have ulcerative colitis. Doctors don't know how or why these conditions are connected.","Your doctor will want to take a sample of your blood to check the levels of your liver enzymes. Unusual levels of certain enzymes could be a sign that you have PSC. To confirm it, you'll have an imaging test called cholangiography to give your doctor a closer look at your bile ducts. There are several different types of cholangiography:","No medications have been shown to help with PSC, but researchers are working on this. You may want to ask your doctor if you qualify for any drug therapy trials. These test medicines that aren't yet approved to treat PSC, and they may help with your symptoms or help control liver damage. If you have an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, your doctor may use special instruments through the endoscope to open blocked bile ducts. Otherwise, the goal is to help your symptoms and control complications that can occur. For example, your doctor may prescribe medications to ease itching, antibiotics to control an infection, or vitamin supplements to help with any deficiencies. If you have liver failure, you may need a liver transplant. Most people with PSC who have one have very good outcomes and quality of life afterward.Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a disease that affects your bile ducts. Bile is a digestive fluid your Liver makes. The ducts let it flow from your liver to your gallbladder and finally to your small intestine. There it helps break down fat from food. With PSC, your bile ducts become inflamed. This causes scars to form that block bile from traveling through them. As a result, it builds up inside your liver and damages your liver cells. It also causes scar tissue to form in your liver. Over time, the scar tissue affects your liver's ability to work the way it should and can lead to cirrhosis and eventually liver failure. PSC can happen at any age. But it's more common in adults than in kids and affects more men than women. About 70% of people with PSC are male."

Fibrous Interstitial Pneumonia,https://www.webmd.com/lung/interstitial-lung-disease,"    Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of many lung conditions. All interstitial lung diseases affect the interstitium, a part of your lungs. The interstitium is a lace-like network of tissue that goes throughout both lungs. It supports your lungs' tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Normally, the interstitium is so thin that it doesn’t show up on X-rays or CT scans.","The most common symptom of all forms of interstitial lung disease is shortness of breath. Almost everyone with ILD will have breathlessness, which can get worse over time. Other symptoms of interstitial lung disease include: With most forms of ILD, shortness of breath develops slowly (over months). If you have interstitial pneumonia or acute interstitial pneumonitis, your symptoms will come on quickly (in hours or days).","The cause of most interstitial lung disease is unknown. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause interstitial pneumonia. You can also get ILD if you regularly breathe in things that can bother your lungs. These include: It’s rare, but certain drugs can cause ILD: Anyone can get interstitial lung disease, but some things can put you at higher risk:","People with interstitial lung disease usually go to the doctor because of shortness of breath or a cough. Your doctor will probably use imaging tests of your lungs to find out the problem. Chest X-ray. A simple chest X-ray is the first test for most people with a breathing problem. Chest X-rays in people with interstitial lung disease may show fine lines in the lungs. CT scan. A CT scan takes multiple X-rays of the chest, and a computer creates detailed images of the lungs and surrounding structures. These tests can usually find interstitial lung disease. High-resolution CT scan. If your doctor thinks you have an interstitial lung disease, certain CT scan settings can get better-quality images of your interstitium. This can help your doctor diagnose you.Lung function test. You sit in a sealed plastic booth and breathe through a tube to measure your total lung capacity, which might be reduced if you have ILD. You may also be less able to transfer oxygen from your lungs into your blood. Lung biopsy. Looking at lung tissue under a microscope is often the only way for a doctor to know which type of interstitial lung disease you have. Lung tissue is collected in a procedure called a lung biopsy, which can be done several ways:","The treatment you get depends on the type of ILD you have and its cause. Antibiotics. These treat most interstitial pneumonias. Pneumonias caused by a virus usually get better on their own. Pneumonias caused by a fungus are rare but are treated with antifungal drugs. Corticosteroids. In some forms of interstitial lung disease, inflammation in your lungs causes damage and scarring. Corticosteroids cause your immune system’s activity to slow. This lessens the amount of inflammation in your lungs and the rest of your body. Inhaled oxygen. If you have low oxygen levels because of interstitial lung disease, inhaled oxygen may help your symptoms. Regular use of oxygen might also protect your heart from damage caused by low oxygen levels. Lung transplant. In advanced interstitial lung disease that has severely impaired you, you may need a lung transplant. Most people who have a lung transplant for interstitial lung disease make large gains in their quality of life and their ability to exercise. Azathioprine (Imuran). This drug also slows down the immune system. It’s not shown to improve interstitial lung disease, but some studies suggest it might help.N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst). This potent antioxidant may slow the decline of lung function in some forms of interstitial lung disease. You’ll take it in combination with other treatments. Other drugs are considered controversial for interstitial lung disease treatment, including:  These medicines affect the way your immune system works. If your doctor thinks you need one, they’ll keep a close watch on you while you’re taking it. These medications can have serious side effects."

Fifth Disease,https://www.webmd.com/children/guide/understanding-fifth-disease-basics,"  Fifth disease, or erythema infectiosum, is a contagious viral infection common among school-age children. It’s most common during winter and spring. Fifth disease got its name many years ago when it was the fifth on a list of the six recognized childhood rash-forming illnesses. The others include rubella, measles, scarlet fever, chickenpox, and roseola infantum.","The most recognized symptom of fifth disease is a sudden, bright red rash across the cheeks that looks as if the child has been slapped. You might also hear it called slapped-cheek disease. The disease is rare in infants and adults.  The rash typically appears a week to 10 days after symptoms similar to those of the common cold, such as: ",Fifth disease is caused by parvovirus B19. This parvovirus only infects humans. Other forms of the virus can infect dogs and cats.,"A doctor can often diagnose fifth disease by looking at the rash. They might do a blood test to check for antibodies to the virus that causes the disease. This test isn’t routine. It’s usually only done in certain situations, for example, if you’re pregnant.   ",The goal of fifth disease treatment is to ease symptoms and make you or your child more comfortable. There’s no specific medicine to treat the virus that causes fifth disease. Your doctor might suggest:
Fine-Needle Aspiration,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/fine-needle-aspiration,"A fine needle aspiration is most often done on swellings or lumps located just under the skin.

Doctors may recommend fine needle aspiration for areas such as: Without a biopsy, it's usually hard for a doctor to confirm what these abnormal areas contain. And you may not know if they are a threat to your health.The most common reason to get a fine needle aspiration is to test for cancer. Most fine needle aspirations are done on these areas: Those types of fine needle aspirations are performed through the skin. Using endoscopy, doctors can also reach areas deeper in the body.

Flesh-Eating Bacteria,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/necrotizing-fasciitis-flesh-eating-bacteria,"Flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) is a rare infection of the skin and tissues below it. It can be deadly if not treated quickly. Necrotizing fasciitis spreads quickly and aggressively in an infected person. It causes tissue death at the infection site and beyond. Every year, between 600 and 700 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. About 25% to 30% of those cases result in death. It rarely happens in children..","The early symptoms of an infection with flesh-eating bacteria usually appear within the first 24 hours of infection. Symptoms are similar to other conditions like the flu or a less serious skin infection. The early symptoms are also similar to common post-surgical complaints, such as: Symptoms often include a combination of the following:More advanced symptoms happen around the painful infection site within 3 to 4 days of infection. They include: Critical symptoms, which often occur within 4 to 5 days of infection, include:  ","Necrotizing fasciitis is commonly caused by group A streptococcus (GAS) bacteria. That's the same type of bacteria that causes strep throat. But, several types of bacteria, such as staphylococcus and others, have also been linked to the disease. Necrotizing fasciitis happens when these types of bacteria infect the superficial fascia, a layer of connective tissue below the skin. Flesh-eating bacteria transmission The bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis can enter the body through:In some cases, it is unknown how the infection began.

The doctor will examine you and review your symptoms. Having flesh-eating bacteria is a medical emergency, and if a doctor suspects you may have it, you’ll likely be admitted to a hospital and get tested there. Tests to diagnosis flesh-eating bacteria (necrotizing fasciitis) include: Blood tests. People with flesh-eating bacteria have high levels of white blood cells. Tissue biopsy. You may need exploratory surgery to remove some of the tissue from the infected area. The tissue is sent to a lab to identify the particular bacteria that’s causing the infection. But you’ll be given some medicine to treat the infection before test results are back.CT scan. A CT scan can show your doctor where fluid and pus are collecting in the body. It also shows the presence of gas bubbles under the skin, which helps confirm the diagnosis. Household members and others who have had close contact with someone with necrotizing fasciitis should be tested for the disease if they have symptoms of an infection.",Patients infected with flesh-eating bacteria will undergo several types of treatment. The extent of treatment depends on the stage of the disease when treatment is started. The treatment includes:

Here are some examples: You don’t eat enough foods that contain folic acid. This is the case for most people. You might not be eating enough foods like leafy green vegetables, beans, citrus fruits, or whole grains. You drink a lot of alcohol. Over time, this makes it harder for your intestines to absorb folate. You have stomach problems. When your small intestine isn’t working the way it should, your body has a hard time hanging on to as much folate as it needs. For instance, people with celiac disease are at risk for this type of anemia. People with cancer are, as well.You’re pregnant. A growing baby absorbs lots of folic acid from its mother. A medication you’re taking is keeping your body from absorbing folate. This is the case with many medicines, such as phenytoin (Dilantin), methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates. You were born with it. Problems absorbing enough folic acid can run in families. Infants with this problem need treatment right away to avoid long-term problems.",,"Folate deficiency anemia is prevented and treated by eating a healthy diet. This includes foods rich in folic acid, such as nuts, leafy green vegetables, enriched breads and cereals, and fruit. Your doctor will also likely prescribe you a daily folic acid supplement.

Follicular Lymphoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/follicular-lymphoma,"Follicular lymphoma is a cancer that affects white blood cells called lymphocytes. They help your body fight infections. There are two types of lymphomas: Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's, based on the kind of white blood cell they affect. Follicular lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When you have follicular lymphoma, the sick blood cells can travel to many parts of your body, such as your organs, bone marrow, and lymph nodes (pea-sized glands in your neck, groin, and under your arms that are part of your immune system). The blood cells can form tumors in these places. Although follicular lymphoma usually can't be cured, you can live long and well with it. This cancer grows slowly. You may not need treatment for many years, or ever. But if you do, it usually works well. Many people live disease-free afterward.","You may have no symptoms of follicular lymphoma. If you do have symptoms, you may have:","Doctors don't know what causes follicular and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Unlike some cancers, they are not passed down in families. In some cases, radiation or cancer-causing chemicals, or certain infections, may be a cause. But other times there is no known cause.You are more likely to get follicular lymphoma as you age. People are 60 years old, on average, when diagnosed. You're also mmay be at an increased risk to get the disease if you have HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or celiac disease, which are all immune system disorders.","First, your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions like:If your doctor notices that you have enlarged lymph nodes, it doesn't mean you have cancer. They're most often caused by infections or other problems. If you do have one, your doctor may give you an antibiotic to see if it shrinks in a few weeks. If you have other lymphoma symptoms or the lymph node is very large, or if it doesn't shrink with antibiotics, your doctor will do a biopsy. To do that, they'll remove either the whole lymph node or part of it. If a node is hard to reach, they may use a very thin needle to remove a little bit of lymph node tissue through your skin. Doctors call this a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. This is usually an ""outpatient"" procedure, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. Sometimes your doctor may numb the area first, but that's not always needed. Using a microscope, experts will check the tissue from the biopsy. If it shows that you have follicular lymphoma, your doctor will want to do other tests. These may include blood tests and:","If you have no symptoms, your doctor may decide just to watch you closely. This is called ""watchful waiting."" Studies show it works as well as early treatment.Your doctor may advise starting treatment if: After treatment, many people stay disease-free for years, although the cancer usually returns. Over time, 30% to 40% of follicular lymphomas behave like or turn into other forms of lymphoma that grow faster and need intensive treatment. If you do need treatment, it may include one or more of the following: Radiation. It kills cancer cells.The radiation comes from a high-energy beam, similar to an X-ray, or from material put inside your body in or near the cancer. Follicular lymphoma responds well to radiation. In some cases, it can cure the cancer. If yours is at an early stage, you may only need radiation. If it's advanced, you may get other treatments as well. Monoclonal antibodies. These are drugs that act like your body's disease-fighting cells. For most people, rituximab (Rituxan) and obinutuzumab (Gazyva) works well to kill lymphoma cells while doing little damage to normal body tissues. It also has fewer side effects than chemotherapy."

Food Addiction,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/eating-disorders/binge-eating-disorder/mental-health-food-addiction,"People who show signs of food addiction may also develop a kind of tolerance to food. They eat more and more, only to find that food satisfies them less and less. Scientists believe that food addiction may play an important role in obesity. But normal-weight people may also struggle with food addiction. Their bodies may simply be genetically programmed to better handle the extra calories they take in. Or they may increase their physical activity to compensate for overeating. People who are addicted to food will continue to eat despite negative consequences, such as weight gain or damaged relationships. And like people who are addicted to drugs or gambling, people who are addicted to food will have trouble stopping their behavior, even if they want to or have tried many times to cut back.","Researchers at Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Science & Policy have developed a questionnaire to identify people with food addictions.

Food Allergies,https://www.webmd.com/allergies/food-allergy-intolerances,"Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract. The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of IgE for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The IgE gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. You won't have a reaction yet, but now you're set up for one. The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that IgE and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body. The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. All of this takes place within a few minutes to an hour.",,,"If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response. One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness. Skin tests are quick, simple, and relatively safe. But experts don't recommend making a diagnosis based on a skin test alone. Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food.If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. It also can't be done if you have severe eczema. Instead, your doctor can use blood tests such as RAST and ELISA that measure the amount of food-specific IgE. These tests may cost more, and results take longer. Again, a positive result doesn't necessarily mean you have a food allergy.","The main way to deal with food allergies is to avoid them. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to. Once you've identified the food, you have to stop eating it. That may mean reading long, detailed ingredient lists because many allergy-triggering foods are in things you wouldn't expect to find them in. Peanuts, for example, may be included for protein, and eggs are in some salad dressings. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen.Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, Symjepi) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room. Parents and caregivers should protect children from their trigger foods and know what to do if the child eats one. Schools should have plans in place to address any related emergency. Children aged 4 to 17 with a severe peanut allergy could benefit from the newly approved drug Palforzia, which may help lessen a severe reaction, although they should still avoid peanuts."

Fractures,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-fractures-basic-information,"A fracture is the medical term for a broken bone. Fractures are common; the average person has two during a lifetime. They occur when the physical force exerted on the bone is stronger than the bone itself. Your risk of fracture depends, in part, on your age. Broken bones are very common in childhood, although children's fractures are generally less complicated than fractures in adults. As you age, your bones become more brittle and you are more likely to suffer fractures from falls that would not occur when you were young.  There are many types of fractures, but the main categories are displaced, non-displaced, open, and closed. Displaced and non-displaced fractures refer to the alignment of the fractured bone. In a displaced fracture, the bone snaps into two or more parts and moves so that the two ends are not lined up straight. If the bone is in many pieces, it is called a comminuted fracture. In a non-displaced fracture, the bone cracks either part or all of the way through, but does move and maintains its proper alignment.A closed fracture is when the bone breaks but there is no puncture or open wound in the skin. An open fracture is one in which the bone breaks through the skin; it may then recede back into the wound and not be visible through the skin. This is an important difference from a closed fracture because with an open fracture there is a risk of a deep bone infection.    Because of the unique properties of their bones, there are some defined fracture subtypes that present only in children. For example: These fracture subtypes can present in children and adults: The severity of a fracture depends upon the fracture subtype and location. Serious fractures can have dangerous complications if not treated promptly; possible complications include damage to blood vessels or nerves and infection of the bone (osteomyelitis) or surrounding tissue. Recuperation time varies depending on the age and health of the patient and the type of fracture. A minor fracture in a child may heal within a few weeks; a serious fracture in an older person may take months to heal.",,,,

Each has its own unique symptoms and timeline. Freezing stage: Frozen stage: Thawing stage:","It’s not clear why some people develop it, but some groups are more at risk. Frozen shoulder happens more often in women than men, and you’re more likely to get it if you’re between the ages of 40 and 60. Your risk might also go up if you’re in the process of recovering from a medical condition like a stroke, or surgery like a mastectomy that keeps you from moving your arm. Certain medical conditions can increase your risk too. You may also be more likely to get frozen shoulder if you have diabetes. About 10% to 20% of people with diabetes get frozen shoulder. Other medical problems like heart disease, thyroid disease, or Parkinson’s disease are linked to frozen shoulder, too. ","To diagnose frozen shoulder, your doctor will give you a physical exam. They'll check it to see how badly it hurts and how far it moves. During the “active” part of the exam, they’ll let you move your shoulder on your own. During the “passive” portion, they’ll move it for you, and note the differences. Your doctor may decide you need an injection of anesthetic in your shoulder. This is a medication that will numb the pain so that they can better judge your active and passive ranges of motion. A physical exam is usually enough to diagnose frozen shoulder, but your doctor may also order imaging tests such as X-rays, ultrasound, or MRI to rule out other problems like arthritis or a torn rotator cuff that can also cause pain and limit how far it moves.","Over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or ibuprofen can help relieve the pain and inflammation in your shoulder. If they don’t help, your doctor might prescribe a stronger medication.Your treatment might also include going to a physical therapist for strengthening and stretching exercises to improve your range of motion. If your symptoms are intense or don’t improve over time, your doctor might recommend other kinds of treatments, including:Frozen shoulder is a condition that affects your shoulder joint. It usually involves pain and stiffness that develops gradually, gets worse and then finally goes away. This can take anywhere from a year to 3 years. Your shoulder is made up of three bones that form a ball-and-socket joint. They are your upper arm (humerus), shoulder blade (scapula), and collarbone (clavicle). There’s also tissue surrounding your shoulder joint that holds everything together. This is called the shoulder capsule. With frozen shoulder, the capsule becomes so thick and tight that it’s hard to move. Bands of scar tissue form and there’s less of a liquid called synovial fluid to keep the joint lubricated. These things limit motion even more."

For women, typical symptoms of a small tumor include:Because changes in a woman's period are obvious, prolactinomas are more likely to be found early in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women, who no longer get their periods, may not notice symptoms when the tumor is small. When a prolactinoma becomes large, it may press up against other nearby tissues.

If the test shows a high prolactin level, your blood also may be tested to find out how well your thyroid is working. If your doctor thinks you might have a pituitary tumor, they may order an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). This uses powerful magnets and radio waves to get a clear picture of your pituitary gland. If a prolactinoma is found, you may need more blood tests to see if your pituitary gland is making other hormones like it should. You may also need more MRIs to see if the tumor grows and if it responds to treatment.","Certain drugs can shrink it, especially when it's small. This works well for about 80% of people who have the tumor. The two approved medications for prolactinoma are bromocriptine (Parlodel) and cabergoline (Dostinex). They are dopamine agonists. These drugs act like the brain chemical dopamine, which normally keeps the pituitary gland from making too much prolactin. When medical treatment works, most premenopausal women get their periods again and regain their fertility. If medication doesn't shrink the tumor, or you can't take it because of side effects (like nausea or dizziness), your doctor may recommend surgery to take the tumor out through your nasal cavity. This returns prolactin levels to normal for about 80% of people with small tumors. But it's successful for only 30% to 40% of people with larger tumors. In rare cases, radiation therapy is used if medicine and surgery don't bring down prolactin levels. This works for about 1 in 3 people.The pituitary gland is a pea-sized gland at the base of your brain. It makes several different hormones, including one called prolactin. Prolactin affects the mammary glands and helps women make breast milk. Sometimes, a tumor grows on the pituitary gland and makes too much prolactin. This kind of tumor is called a prolactinoma. It's the most common type of pituitary tumor and is most often benign, which means it’s not cancer. A new mom's prolactin levels go up every time their baby nurses. But for men or women who aren't nursing, high prolactin in the blood can be a sign of a prolactinoma. Doctors don't know what causes it, but it's fairly common. It happens more often in women than men, and it's rare in kids."
Galactose-1-Phosphate Uridyl Transferase Deficiency,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-galactrosemia,"Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it. If your baby has this condition, it means the genes that produce the enzymes to break down galactose into glucose (a sugar) are missing key parts. Without these parts, the genes can’t tell the enzymes to do their job. This causes galactose to build up in the blood, creating problems, especially for newborns.There are three main types of galactosemia: Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common. As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia. If you’re a carrier, it doesn’t mean you have to avoid galactose. But it means you can pass galactosemia along to your children.","If your newborn has classic galactosemia, they’ll appear normal at birth. Symptoms start to show up within a few days after they begin to drink breast milk or formula with lactose -- the milk sugar that contains galactose. Your baby first loses their appetite and starts vomiting. Then they get jaundice, a yellowing of the skin and the whites of their eyes. Diarrhea is common, too. The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive. Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections. They may have liver damage and kidney problems. Their brain may not mature well. That can cause developmental disabilities. Some children have issues with their motor skills and muscles.

Galactosemia,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-galactrosemia,"Galactosemia is hereditary. Both parents must pass it down for their child to get it.

This causes galactose to build up in the blood, creating problems, especially for newborns.There are three main types of galactosemia: Type I occurs in about 1 in every 30,000 to 60,000 people. Type II and type III are less common. As a parent or potential parent, you and your partner can be genetically screened for galactosemia.

The disease leads to severe weight loss and your baby struggles to grow and thrive. Without treatment, over time your child may develop cataracts and can be susceptible to infections.

Gallbladder Inflammation,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-cholecystitis,"Cholecystitis is a swelling and irritation of your gallbladder, a small organ in the right side of your belly near your liver. The gallbladder’s job is to hold a digestive juice called bile. It releases bile into your small intestine when your body needs it to break down fats. But if the path to your small intestine is blocked, bile gets trapped. That backup can irritate your gallbladder. That’s how cholecystitis happens. Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms. They often show up after you’ve eaten a big or especially fatty meal. It’s easy to mistake cholecystitis for other health problems, but another telltale sign is intense pain -- in your belly, in your back, or under your right shoulder blade. If you don’t see a doctor and get treatment, it can lead to dangerous infections or become a long-term condition. The most common solution is surgery to remove your gallbladder.","Cholecystitis can mimic other health problems, so you’ll need to see a doctor for a diagnosis.You might feel a sharp, sudden pain in the upper right side of your belly. You may also feel pain in your back or below your right shoulder blade. Deep breaths may make it worse. Some other symptoms to watch out for include: Symptoms may get worse after a high-fat meal. If you can’t get comfortable or sit still because your pain is so strong, head to an emergency room.","You have a higher chance of getting cholecystitis if you: Or if you have: You also run a bigger chance of getting it if your diet is high in fat and cholesterol or your ancestry is Native American, Hispanic, or Scandinavian.","The doctor will examine you, ask a few questions about your symptoms, and probably order some tests. You should be ready to: Your doctor can tell from blood tests whether you have an infection and whether your liver is working the way it should. They may also want you to have some imaging tests. These may include:  ","If you have cholecystitis, especially an acute case, you may have to spend some time in the hospital. You will have to keep your stomach empty so your gallbladder can rest. You’ll probably get fluids through a tube put into a vein. You may get pain medicine and, if doctors are concerned about infection, an antibiotic. Once treatment begins, you should start to feel better. If gallstones caused your problem, doctors may try medications to dissolve them and give you a prescription drug to keep them from forming again. A very low-fat diet may also keep them from coming back."
Gallstones,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/gallstones,"Gallstones are pieces of solid material that form in your gallbladder, a small organ under your liver. If you have them, you might hear your doctor say you have cholelithiasis. Your gallbladder stores and releases bile, a fluid made in your liver, to help in digestion. Bile also carries wastes like cholesterol and bilirubin, which your body makes when it breaks down red blood cells. These things can form gallstones. Gallstones can range in size from a grain of sand to a golf ball. You might not know that you have them until they block a bile duct, causing pain that needs treatment right away.","Gallstones don't normally cause symptoms. Symptoms occur only when a gallstone gets stuck and blocks the flow of bile through your system.If you have symptoms, they may include: See your doctor or go to the hospital if you have signs of a serious infection or inflammation:",You're more likely to get gallstones if you:,"Your doctor will do a physical exam and might order tests including: Blood tests. These check for signs of infection or blockage, and rule out other conditions. Ultrasound. This makes images of the inside of your body. CT scan. Specialized X-rays let your doctor see inside your body, including your gallbladder. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). This test uses a magnetic field and pulses of radio waves to make pictures of the inside of your body, including your liver and gallbladder.Cholescintigraphy (HIDA scan). This test can check whether your gallbladder squeezes correctly. Your doctor injects a harmless radioactive material that makes its way to the organ. A technician can then watch its movement. This can help diagnose cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) from gallstones. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Your doctor runs a tube called an endoscope through your mouth down to your small intestine. They inject a dye so they can see your bile ducts on a camera in the endoscope. They can often take out any gallstones that have moved into the ducts, but that’s only done if treatment is planned as part of the procedure since it’s invasive. Endoscopic ultrasound. This test combines ultrasound and endoscopy to look for gallstones that may be in places that are hard to see with other imaging, such as in the common bile duct as it passes through the pancreas.","You don’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms. Some small gallstones can pass through your body on their own.Most people with gallstones have their gallbladders taken out. You can still digest food without it. Your doctor will use one of two procedures. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This is the most common surgery for gallstones. The surgeon works through tiny cuts (incisions). They pass a narrow tube called a laparoscope into your belly through a small cut. The tube contains a tiny light and a camera. The doctor will take out your gallbladder through another small cut using special devices. You’ll usually go home the same day. Open cholecystectomy. Your doctor makes bigger cuts in your belly to remove your gallbladder. You’ll stay in the hospital for a few days afterward. You’ll need open surgery if you have a bleeding disorder. You may also need it if you have severe gallbladder disease, are very overweight, or are in your last trimester of pregnancy."

Ganglions,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ganglion-cyst,"A ganglion cyst is a small sac of fluid that forms over a joint or tendon (tissue that connects muscle to bone). Inside the cyst is a thick, sticky, clear, colorless, jellylike material. Depending on the size, cysts may feel firm or spongy. Ganglion cysts, also known as bible cysts, most commonly show up on the back of the hand at the wrist joint but they can also develop on the palm side of the wrist. They can also show up in other areas, but these are less common:",Symptoms of a ganglion cyst can include:The below image shows a traumatic ganglion cyst. This person came to the emergency department with a painful bump after the wrist was hit by a car door.   The image below shows the jellylike fluid taken from the cyst in the above image. Its presence confirms the diagnosis of a ganglion cyst.   An ultrasound image below shows the ganglion cyst (area between markers).   The below image shows a ganglion cyst that has been operated on in the past. This ganglion returned because this person plays the cymbals in their school band.  ,"The cause of ganglion cysts is not known. One theory suggests that trauma causes the tissue of the joint to break down, forming small cysts that then join into a larger, more obvious mass. The most likely theory involves a flaw in the joint capsule or tendon sheath that allows the joint tissue to bulge out. Ganglion cysts are more common in women, and 70% occur in people between the ages of 20-40. Rarely, ganglion cysts can occur in children younger than 10 years.","If you have a bump, you should see your doctor, even if you don’t have symptoms that bother you. A physical exam is often all that is needed to diagnose a ganglion cyst.","A ganglion cyst doesn’t need emergency treatment unless you have significant trauma. A routine check by either your doctor or a specialist in bones and joints (an orthopedist) is often enough.Self-care at home If your cyst isn’t bothering you, your doctor may tell you to keep an eye on it and be in touch if anything changes. Many cysts can disappear without any treatment at all. In the past, home care for these growths included topical plaster, heat, and various poultices. It even extended to use of a heavy book to physically smash the cyst. These forms of treatment are no longer suggested, because they have not been shown to keep the ganglion cysts from returning and could, in fact, cause further injury. Medical treatment If your cyst is bothering you, your doctor may recommend one of these treatments:"
Gangliosidosis GM2 Type 2,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-tay-sachs-disease,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. There’s no cure for the disease, but scientists have a good idea of what causes it, how it worsens, and how to use genetic testing to screen for it early in pregnancy. Researchers are working to make advances in gene therapy or bone marrow transplants that they hope will allow treatment of Tay-Sachs in the future","A baby born with Tay-Sachs grows like they should until 3 to 6 months of age. Around this time, parents might notice that their baby’s development starts to slow and their muscles weaken. Over time, the disease causes more symptoms in babies, including: A loss of motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling A very strong reaction to loud noises Trouble focusing on objects or following them with their eyes Cherry-red spots, which can be identified with an eye exam, in the eyesBy age 2, most children with Tay-Sachs have started getting more serious problems. They can include: Swallowing and breathing issues that keep getting worse Seizures Loss of mental function, hearing, and sight Paralysis Past age 3, there are few visible changes in children with Tay-Sachs, but their nervous system continues to get worse, often leading to death by age 5.","Defects in a gene called HEXA cause Tay-Sachs. (You can think of genes as “coding” that your parents pass along to you. Genes are in your cells, and they set your body’s traits -- everything from your eye color and blood type to your sex.) Most people have two healthy versions of this HEXA gene, which gives instructions to your body to make an enzyme (a type of protein) known as Hex-A. This enzyme prevents the buildup of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in your brain and spinal cord. Some people have just one healthy copy of the gene, and they still make enough Hex-A protein to keep the brain and spinal cord healthy. But babies born with Tay-Sachs disease got a changed copy of the gene from both parents, so they don’t make any Hex-A protein. This is what makes them so sick.Over time, GM2 ganglioside builds up in their nervous system and starts to cause damage. The disease is very rare. It affects only about 1 in every 112,000 live births. Anyone can be a carrier of a HEXA mutation, meaning they have just one defective copy of the HEXA gene. But the chance of inheriting the disease is higher in certain groups because of a higher rate of carriers. About 1 in every 27 Jewish people in the United States is a carrier. Non-Jewish French Canadians living near the St. Lawrence River in Canada and in the Cajun community of Louisiana also have a higher incidence of Tay-Sachs. If both parents are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease.","Pregnant women can have a test to find out whether their unborn babies have the problem that causes Tay-Sachs. If the tests don’t find any Hex-A protein, the baby has Tay-Sachs. If the tests find Hex-A, the baby doesn’t have the disease.These tests include: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor takes a  small sample of the placenta with a needle or small tube and analyzes it. They can do this between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis. The doctor uses a needle to take a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby and tests it. To diagnose Tay-Sachs in a baby after it’s born: Your doctor will ask you about your baby’s symptoms and your family history. They’ll do a blood test to check Hex-A levels.  The doctor will check the baby’s eyes. A cherry-red spot in the back of the eyes is a sign of Tay-Sachs. If it’s there, you may need to take your baby to specialists, such as a pediatric neurologist and an opthalmologist, for more tests.","Some of the specialists, treatments, and programs you might consider include: Speech-language pathologists. They can provide ways to help your baby keep the suck-swallow reflex going as well as help you figure out when it is time to consider a feeding tube for your little one. Neurologists. These specialists can help you manage your baby’s seizures with medication.  Respiratory health. Specialists such as pediatricians and pulmonologists (doctors who treat lung and breathing problems) can recommend ways for parents to lower their child’s chance of lung infections. Chest physiotherapy (CPT). Therapy to tap on the chest wall can help break up mucus in the lungs so your child can cough it up. Feeding tubes. Your child may have trouble swallowing or may have breathing problems that include inhaling food or liquid into their lungs while eating. You can insert a feeding tube through your child’s nose into their stomach each time. Or a doctor may put in a tube during surgery. Play and stimulation. You can help your child interact with the world through music, scents, and textures. Massages. These can relax your baby. Palliative and hospice care. These programs help manage quality of life for children with Tay-Sachs and their families."
Ganser Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/ganser-syndrome,t is difficult to predict whether and when symptoms of Ganser syndrome are likely to go away. The likelihood for recovery from Ganser syndrome can vary greatly depending on whether the symptoms arose suddenly in response to a stressful experience or reflect a more long-term pattern.,"People with Ganser syndrome have short-term episodes of odd behavior similar to that shown by people with other serious mental illnesses. The person may appear confused, make absurd statements, and report hallucinations such as the experience of sensing things that are not there or hearing voices. A classic symptom of Ganser syndrome is vorbeireden. This is when the person gives nonsense answers to simple questions. In addition, a person with this condition may report physical problems such as an inability to move part of the body, called ""hysterical paralysis."" Loss of memory (amnesia) of the events that occurred during an episode is common.","Little is known about this unusual disorder, but it is believed to be a reaction to extreme stress. There are also physical problems that may cause the symptoms of Ganser syndrome such as alcoholism, head injury, and stroke. Most people with this condition also have a personality disorder, usually antisocial personality disorder or histrionic personality disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by irresponsible and aggressive behavior that often involves a disregard for others and an inability to abide by society's rules. People with antisocial personality disorder are sometimes referred to as ""sociopaths"" or ""psychopaths."" For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and does not arise from a true feeling of self-worth. They have an overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention.",," It is difficult to predict whether and when symptoms of Ganser syndrome are likely to go away. This is partly because people with Ganser Syndrome often present with fake symptoms not just simply in response to a stressful event, but because the condition often reflects someone's limited ability to cope effectively with stresses when they occur. Supportive psychotherapy (a type of counseling), and monitoring for safety and a return of symptoms are the main treatments for Ganser syndrome. Medication usually is not generally used, unless the person also suffers from depression, anxiety, or psychosis."
Gardner Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/understanding-colorectal-cancer-basics,,,,,
Gargoylism,https://www.webmd.com/children/mucopolysaccharidosis-i-mps-i,"MPS I stands for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. It starts in childhood. You can't ""catch"" it -- it comes from your genes. People with MPS I can't make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease.  Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms:","Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar:MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways:","MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene. If you get one normal gene and one ""bad"" gene, you won't have symptoms of MPS I. You could pass the gene to your children, though.","Because it's a rare disease, doctors rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor might ask: If the doctors can't find another explanation for your child's symptoms, they'll test for MPS I by checking for:After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you are pregnant, know you are a carrier of the gene, and already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing. ","Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) uses a drug called laronidase (Aldurazyme), a man-made version of the missing protein. It has changed the outlook for many kids with MPS I. It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning.Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. These cells often come from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better.

But if too much or too little GH is in your body, there may be something wrong with your pituitary gland. In children, you may find this out during a visit with your pediatrician. During a typical visit, your pediatrician will likely check your child for height, weight, and head size and see how they compare with the normal range for children of that age. If the measurements are outside that range, they may order tests. If you’re an adult, you may want to visit your doctor if your symptoms include:There are many different possible causes for these symptoms, but they may also signal issues with GH production. A test can measure the amount of GH in your blood. Your pituitary gland releases GH in pulses that vary by sex, age, and even time of day. That is why doctors use different methods to stimulate or suppress the release of growth hormone before you take the test.",,,"For your child, the test begins with a technician placing an IV line in their arm or hand.After giving a blood sample, your child will get a dose of medicine or medicines to stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone. The most common medicines chosen are clonidine (Catapres), arginine or glucagon. Insulin is less commonly used now because of safety concerns with children. During all of this, the assistant will probably take a blood sample around every 30 minutes. The samples are not large -- perhaps a couple of teaspoons, total, over the course of the day. At the end of the test, your child can eat. They should rest afterwards. It’s a similar process for adults who get the GH stimulation test. Adults have the option of a medicine called macimorelin (Macrilen)which is given as a liquid to drink. Insulin is less often used now because of unpleasant side effects and safety concerns due to low blood sugars. Both children and adult blood samples can also be checked for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 alongside the stimulation test.",
Gianotti Crosti Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/picture-of-gianetti-crosti-syndrome,"The main symptom -- the rash -- will go away on its own. But if it’s itchy, you can use over-the-counter anti-itch treatments to ease the symptoms. Your doctor may suggest oral antihistamines if topical treatments don't help. Cool compresses may also reduce itching. If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about using a fever reducer such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Ask about appropriate dosing for your child's age. Make sure your child drinks plenty of fluids, since fevers can be dehydrating.  Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is not contagious, so you don't need to isolate your child while they have the rash. In fact, the rash usually appears after the child has stopped being contagious with the virus that triggered the syndrome. Your child can participate in activities while the rash is still present, though you may need a note from your doctor to explain the situation.Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rash that usually affects young children. It's sometimes called papular acrodermatitis of childhood. The rash covers the arms, legs, and face. It can cause itching and discomfort. Gianotti-Crosti is usually a delayed immune reaction to a virus. The rash will appear as your child is recovering from an illness such as a respiratory infection or stomach virus. It's very common and doesn't have lasting effects, but it can be alarming when it appears on your child's skin.","A Gianotti-Costi rash looks like an outbreak of raised blisters that appear on your child's skin. The rash often first appears on or near the buttocks, then spreads to the arms, legs, and face. The blisters vary in size and may be filled with fluid. They may be pink, red, or brown in color.The blisters may become itchy or uncomfortable. Your child may also have swollen lymph nodes and a mild fever along with the rash. Children may also experience swelling of the liver or spleen, but you would need a doctor to confirm those symptoms.  The rash usually lasts about four weeks, though it can linger as long as eight weeks. It will go away on its own. The rash doesn't typically cause scarring on the skin. There may be dark spots that remain on the skin, but they generally fade after six months. Any other symptoms will also clear up over time. ","Viral illnesses trigger Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. The rash will typically begin as your child is recovering from another illness. Some children also get it after receiving live-virus vaccinations, such as the shots for poliovirus, hepatitis A, diphtheria, smallpox, pertussis, and influenza. It's most common in children under the age of 9 years old, and children with underlying skin conditions like atopic dermatitis are also more likely to develop Gianotti-Crosti. Adults can get it, too, with women being more susceptible to it than men. The condition is most prevalent in spring and summer.Doctors aren't sure why some viruses lead to a Gianotti-Crosti response. There is a broad assumption that it's part of the immune response to viruses, but experts don't know exactly why some people get it while others don't‌.  The most common triggers for Gianotti-Crosti in the United States include: In regions other than the United States, hepatitis B is a common trigger for Gianotti-Crosti syndrome. In the United States, children are usually vaccinated against hepatitis B.

Other symptoms may include: If you notice these symptoms, let your doctor know.","It’s an autoimmune disease. That means your immune system mistakenly attacks your body's healthy tissues. In giant cell arteritis, immune cells react against blood vessels and make them inflamed. Doctors don't know what triggers this, but you're more likely to get it if you're:","Your doctor will do an exam and ask about your symptoms. They’ll also look for swelling and a weak pulse in the temporal artery in your scalp.You may need a biopsy of the temporal artery. If so, your doctor will numb an area of your scalp and remove a small piece of the temporal artery. A doctor will then check it under a microscope. The cells of an inflamed artery look very large under the microscope. Your doctor also might do one or more of these: When arteries are inflamed, blood can't move as easily through them. Giant cell arteritis can keep oxygen from getting to your eyes, and this can damage them. You might need to see an eye doctor to check for this.","If you have giant cell arteritis, your doctor will start you on medication right away to prevent vision loss and other problems. The main treatment is high doses of steroids, such as prednisone, to reduce inflammation in the arteries. You'll take this medication by mouth every day.Most people stay on a steroid for 1 to 2 years. Your doctor will do blood tests every few months to see if the inflammation in your arteries has gone down. As it does, your doctor will lower the dose of your medicine. These medications can weaken your bones, so your doctor might suggest regular bone mineral density tests. Your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin D supplements, along with a prescription drug called a bisphosphonate, to slow down or prevent bone damage. Other medications that may be used include methotrexate, a drug commonly used to treat cancer as well as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to lessen the amount of steroids a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids. You also might take aspirin to thin your blood and prevent clots.Giant cell arteritis, also called temporal arteritis, is a disease that causes your arteries -- blood vessels that carry oxygen from your heart to the rest of your body -- to become inflamed. It usually happens to the large and medium-sized temporal arteries that run along both sides of your head. The cells of these inflamed arteries look giant under a microscope, which is how the condition got its name. The swelling slows blood flow through your arteries, and that can cause symptoms like headaches and pain in your face and joints. Left untreated, narrowed arteries can cause vision problems and blindness. Medication can help your symptoms and prevent serious health issues."
"Giant Cell Glioblastoma, Astrocytoma",https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-astrocytoma,"As the astrocytoma grows and presses against the brain, it can cause symptoms.

They depend partly on where and how big your tumor is. Early symptoms include:",,,"You and your doctor will make a treatment plan based on the type of astrocytoma you have, where it is, how fast it's growing, and your symptoms.  Astrocytoma is the most common a type of glioma tumor that  can develop in the brain and spinal cord. It’s more common in men than women and most often shows up after age 45. There are several types of astrocytoma, and some grow faster than others. They get their name from astrocytes, the star-shaped cells where they form in the brain. About 50% of primary brain tumors are astrocytomas. Read on to learn more about symptoms, types, and treatments."
"Giant Cell Glioblastoma, Multiforme",https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma, a cancer that forms from star-shaped cells in the brain called astrocytes. In adults, this cancer usually starts in the cerebrum, the largest part of your brain. Glioblastoma tumors make their own blood supply, which helps them grow. It's easy for them to invade normal brain tissue.","Because glioblastomas grow quickly, pressure on the brain usually causes the first symptoms. Depending on where the tumor is, it can cause: ","Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes glioblastoma. But certain things may make you more likely to have one, such as: Prior radiation to the head. If you previously got radiation to treat brain tumors or cancers that may have spread to the area, it can increase your risk for glioblastoma. Rare genetic conditions. If you have hereditary disorders linked to genetic mutations such as: Exposure to chemicals and other cancer-causing agents may also increase your risk for genetic mutations. Age and gender. It’s more common among those who are 50 or above. The average age for diagnosis is 64. Men are more likely to have it. Race. It’s more common among white people than among Black, Asian, and Indigenous groups.","A neurologist (a doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating brain disorders) will give you a complete exam. You may get an MRI or CT scan and other tests, depending on your symptoms.","The goal of glioblastoma treatment is to slow and control tumor growth and help you live as comfortably and as well as possible. There are four treatments, and many people get more than one type: Surgery is the first treatment. The surgeon tries to remove as much of the tumor as possible. In high-risk areas of the brain, it may not be possible to remove all of it.Radiation is used to kill as many leftover tumor cells as possible after surgery. It can also slow the growth of tumors that can't be removed by surgery. Chemotherapy may also help. Temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy drug doctors use for glioblastoma. Carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU) are other chemotherapy drugs that might be used. Targeted therapy with the drug bevacizumab (Avastin, Mvasi) may be given if chemotherapy has not been effective. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses a pump to release a slow, continuous stream of chemotherapy or targeted therapies to a tumor. Electric field therapy uses electrical fields to target cells in the tumor while not hurting normal cells. To do this, doctors put electrodes directly on the scalp. The device is called Optune. You get it with chemotherapy after surgery and radiation. The FDA has approved it for both newly diagnosed people and people whose glioblastoma has come back. Wafer therapy (Gliadel) uses an implanted, biodegradable disc that releases chemotherapy to any cancerous tissue that is left after surgery. Nanoparticle therapy uses tiny particles to carry chemotherapy directly into the tumor."
Giant Cell Interstitial Pneumonia,https://www.webmd.com/lung/interstitial-lung-disease,"    Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of many lung conditions. All interstitial lung diseases affect the interstitium, a part of your lungs. The interstitium is a lace-like network of tissue that goes throughout both lungs. It supports your lungs' tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Normally, the interstitium is so thin that it doesn’t show up on X-rays or CT scans.","The most common symptom of all forms of interstitial lung disease is shortness of breath. Almost everyone with ILD will have breathlessness, which can get worse over time. Other symptoms of interstitial lung disease include: With most forms of ILD, shortness of breath develops slowly (over months). If you have interstitial pneumonia or acute interstitial pneumonitis, your symptoms will come on quickly (in hours or days).","The cause of most interstitial lung disease is unknown. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause interstitial pneumonia. You can also get ILD if you regularly breathe in things that can bother your lungs. These include: It’s rare, but certain drugs can cause ILD: Anyone can get interstitial lung disease, but some things can put you at higher risk:","People with interstitial lung disease usually go to the doctor because of shortness of breath or a cough. Your doctor will probably use imaging tests of your lungs to find out the problem. Chest X-ray. A simple chest X-ray is the first test for most people with a breathing problem. Chest X-rays in people with interstitial lung disease may show fine lines in the lungs. CT scan. A CT scan takes multiple X-rays of the chest, and a computer creates detailed images of the lungs and surrounding structures. These tests can usually find interstitial lung disease. High-resolution CT scan. If your doctor thinks you have an interstitial lung disease, certain CT scan settings can get better-quality images of your interstitium. This can help your doctor diagnose you.Lung function test. You sit in a sealed plastic booth and breathe through a tube to measure your total lung capacity, which might be reduced if you have ILD. You may also be less able to transfer oxygen from your lungs into your blood. Lung biopsy. Looking at lung tissue under a microscope is often the only way for a doctor to know which type of interstitial lung disease you have. Lung tissue is collected in a procedure called a lung biopsy, which can be done several ways:","The treatment you get depends on the type of ILD you have and its cause. Antibiotics. These treat most interstitial pneumonias. Pneumonias caused by a virus usually get better on their own. Pneumonias caused by a fungus are rare but are treated with antifungal drugs. Corticosteroids. In some forms of interstitial lung disease, inflammation in your lungs causes damage and scarring. Corticosteroids cause your immune system’s activity to slow. This lessens the amount of inflammation in your lungs and the rest of your body. Inhaled oxygen. If you have low oxygen levels because of interstitial lung disease, inhaled oxygen may help your symptoms. Regular use of oxygen might also protect your heart from damage caused by low oxygen levels. Lung transplant. In advanced interstitial lung disease that has severely impaired you, you may need a lung transplant. Most people who have a lung transplant for interstitial lung disease make large gains in their quality of life and their ability to exercise. Azathioprine (Imuran). This drug also slows down the immune system. It’s not shown to improve interstitial lung disease, but some studies suggest it might help.N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst). This potent antioxidant may slow the decline of lung function in some forms of interstitial lung disease. You’ll take it in combination with other treatments. Other drugs are considered controversial for interstitial lung disease treatment, including:  These medicines affect the way your immune system works. If your doctor thinks you need one, they’ll keep a close watch on you while you’re taking it. These medications can have serious side effects."
Giant Cyst of the Retina,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-is-retinoschisis,"This rare condition, sometimes called XJR, mainly affects boys and men. It damages an area in the middle of the retina called the macula. The macula gives you clear central vision, and lets you focus on things in front of you, like a book or computer. Sometimes the condition also can affect your side, or peripheral, vision. Causes XJR is caused by a change -- or mutation -- to a gene. If a girl gets the problem gene from a parent, they’ll carry the disorder but won't have symptoms. If a boy gets the gene, they’ll have the disorder.If a mother has the gene, their female children have a 50% chance of being a carrier. Their male children have a 50% chance of having the disorder. Men who have the gene can't pass it to their sons, but their daughters will be carriers. Symptoms XJR starts at birth and usually affects both eyes. Symptoms can appear in the first few months of life. Some boys, though, aren't diagnosed until they start school and have trouble reading. Their vision often gets worse during childhood and then levels off for a while. When a man reaches their 50s and 60s, their vision might start to worsen again. Some people lose a lot of their vision by adulthood, but it's rare for retinoschisis to cause blindness. Other symptoms include: In rare cases, the retina will pull away from the eye completely. This is called retinal detachment, and it can lead to serious vision loss. People who have retinal detachment will need surgery to fix it.",,,,

Glandular Plague,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/plague-faq,"The plague is caused by bacteria called Yersinia pestis. It’s usually spread by fleas. These bugs pick up the germs when they bite infected animals like rats, mice, or squirrels. Then they pass it to the next animal or person they bite. You can also catch the plague directly from infected animals or people. Thanks to treatment and prevention, the plague is rare now. Only a few thousand people around the world get it each year. Most of the cases are in Africa (especially the Democratic Republic of Congo and Madagascar), India, and Peru. The U.S. sees about seven cases a year, mostly in rural or remote areas in Southwestern states like Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and California.","After people catch the plague, the symptoms start 1-6 days later. You feel very sick and weak and may have a fever, chills, and headaches. Other symptoms depend on the three main kinds of plague: Bubonic plague. This is the most common type. It causes buboes, which are very swollen and painful lymph nodes under the arms, in the neck, or in the groin. Without treatment, the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body. Septicemic plague. This type is more dangerous than bubonic plague. It’s when the bacteria have moved into the blood. Signs include: Pneumonic plague. This is when the bacteria are in the lungs.

Glaucoma,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/glaucoma-eyes,"Glaucoma is a condition that damages your eye's optic nerve. It gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside your eye. Glaucoma tends to run in families. You usually don’t get it until later in life. The increased pressure in your eye, called intraocular pressure, can damage your optic nerve, which sends images to your brain. If the damage worsens, glaucoma can cause permanent vision loss or even total blindness within a few years. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain. Visit your eye doctor regularly so they can diagnose and treat glaucoma before you have long-term vision loss. If you lose vision, it can’t be brought back. But lowering eye pressure can help you keep the sight you have. Most people with glaucoma who follow their treatment plan and have regular eye exams are able to keep their vision.","Most people with open-angle glaucoma don’t have symptoms. If symptoms do develop, it’s usually late in the disease. That’s why glaucoma is often called the ""sneak thief of vision."" The main sign is usually a loss of side, or peripheral, vision. Symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma usually come on faster and are more obvious. Damage can happen quickly. If you have any of these symptoms, get medical care right away:","It mostly affects adults over 40, but young adults, children, and even infants can have it. African American people tend to get it more often, when they're younger, and with more vision loss. You’re more likely to get it if you:","Glaucoma tests are painless and don’t take long. Your eye doctor will test your vision. They’ll use drops to widen (dilate) your pupils and examine your eyes. They’ll check your optic nerve for signs of glaucoma. They may take photographs so they can spot changes at your next visit. They’ll do a test called tonometry to check your eye pressure. They may also do a visual field test to see if you've lost peripheral vision. If your doctor suspects glaucoma, they may order special imaging tests of your optic nerve.","Open-angle glaucoma is most often treated with combinations of eye drops, laser trabeculoplasty, and microsurgery. Doctors tend to start with medications, but early laser surgery or microsurgery could work better for some people.  Eye drops. These either lower the creation of fluid in your eye or increase its flow out, lowering eye pressure. Side effects can include allergies, redness, stinging, blurred vision, and irritated eyes. Some glaucoma drugs may affect your heart and lungs. Because of potential drug interactions, be sure to tell your doctor about any other medical problems you have or other medications you take. Also let them know if it’s hard for you to follow a regimen involving two or three different eye drops or if they have side effects. They may be able to change your treatment. Oral medication. Your doctor might also prescribe medication for you to take by mouth, such as a beta-blocker or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. These drugs can improve drainage or slow the creation of fluid in your eye.Laser surgery. This procedure can slightly raise the flow of fluid from your eye if you have open-angle glaucoma. It can stop fluid blockage if you have angle-closure glaucoma. Procedures include: Microsurgery. In a procedure called a trabeculectomy, your doctor creates a new channel to drain the fluid and ease eye pressure. This form of surgery may need to be done more than once. Your doctor might implant a tube to help drain fluid. This surgery can lead to temporary or permanent vision loss, as well as bleeding or infection. Minimally invasive glaucoma surgeries (MIGS). This is a newer less invasive form of surgery which usually requires tiny openings and uses devices you can’t see with the naked eye. Its generally faster and safer, but won’t lower pressure by quite as much. The procedure can also be done at the same time as other procedures like cataract surgery."
Glioblastoma Multiforme,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/brain-cancer/what-is-glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma is a type of astrocytoma, a cancer that forms from star-shaped cells in the brain called astrocytes. In adults, this cancer usually starts in the cerebrum, the largest part of your brain. Glioblastoma tumors make their own blood supply, which helps them grow. It's easy for them to invade normal brain tissue.","Because glioblastomas grow quickly, pressure on the brain usually causes the first symptoms. Depending on where the tumor is, it can cause: ","Experts aren’t exactly sure what causes glioblastoma. But certain things may make you more likely to have one, such as: Prior radiation to the head. If you previously got radiation to treat brain tumors or cancers that may have spread to the area, it can increase your risk for glioblastoma. Rare genetic conditions. If you have hereditary disorders linked to genetic mutations such as: Exposure to chemicals and other cancer-causing agents may also increase your risk for genetic mutations. Age and gender. It’s more common among those who are 50 or above. The average age for diagnosis is 64. Men are more likely to have it. Race.

There are four treatments, and many people get more than one type: Surgery is the first treatment. The surgeon tries to remove as much of the tumor as possible. In high-risk areas of the brain, it may not be possible to remove all of it.Radiation is used to kill as many leftover tumor cells as possible after surgery. It can also slow the growth of tumors that can't be removed by surgery. Chemotherapy may also help. Temozolomide is the most common chemotherapy drug doctors use for glioblastoma. Carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU) are other chemotherapy drugs that might be used. Targeted therapy with the drug bevacizumab (Avastin, Mvasi) may be given if chemotherapy has not been effective. Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) uses a pump to release a slow, continuous stream of chemotherapy or targeted therapies to a tumor. Electric field therapy uses electrical fields to target cells in the tumor while not hurting normal cells. To do this, doctors put electrodes directly on the scalp. The device is called Optune. You get it with chemotherapy after surgery and radiation. The FDA has approved it for both newly diagnosed people and people whose glioblastoma has come back. Wafer therapy (Gliadel) uses an implanted, biodegradable disc that releases chemotherapy to any cancerous tissue that is left after surgery. Nanoparticle therapy uses tiny particles to carry chemotherapy directly into the tumor."

They can form quickly or very slowly over years. Before iodized salt was introduced in 1920, iodine deficiency was the main cause of goiters in the U.S. It still is worldwide. In the U.S., the main causes of goiters are autoimmune disorders (including Graves' disease or Hashimoto's disease) and multinodular goiter. Inflammation of the thyroid, called thyroiditis, can also cause a goiter. You can get this after getting sick from a virus or after giving birth.  Risk factors for goiters include:","Often, your doctor will diagnose your goiter simply by examining your neck. You may then have tests to find out what caused it and how it affects you. They include:","A goiter may not need treatment, especially if it is small and thyroid hormone levels are normal. But if your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, you will need treatment.Treatment involves getting the thyroid hormone levels back to normal. Depending on what caused your goiter and how serious it is, your doctor can treat it with: If you have a goiter, your doctor may want to check it on a periodic basis with ultrasound to be sure that it isn’t growing larger or developing suspicious looking nodules that might call for a fine-needle biopsy."

Graft versus Host Disease,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/graft-versus-host-disease,"GVHD can show up in several different parts of your body. Usually, it affects your skin, digestive system, or liver. It often starts as an itchy rash on your palms and the soles of your feet. You may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some of these symptoms can be side effects of the transplant or of procedures or medications that go along with it. They can also mean you have an infection. Your doctor may take a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, from the affected part of your body to find out. A specialist will look for signs of GVHD in the sample under a microscope.There are two main types, based on when symptoms show up. Acute GVHD usually happens within 100 days of the transplant.

A transplant of someone else's bone marrow or stem cells lets your body make new blood cells. But with GVHD, donor immune cells can attack your healthy cells as if they were bacteria or a virus. You're most likely to get it if your proteins which protect your body's cells don't match your donor's very well. Other things that can increase your risk include: The more closely your cells match those of your donor, the better. Unless you have an identical twin, your best match will be a sibling or parent. But you may find a good match in a national registry. The risk also goes down if doctors get the donor cells from umbilical cord blood rather than peripheral blood or bone marrow. Certain medications taken before and after the transplant can help prevent GVHD. You'll get a combination of drugs that slow down your immune system to keep the new white blood cells from going on the attack.",,"If your GVHD is severe enough to need treatment, your doctor probably will prescribe a combination of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and drugs that slow down your immune system, such as cyclosporine. Those can make it harder for your body to fight infections, so you may also get prophylactic antibiotics. If the problem persists, your doctor may prescribe a kinase inhibitor. Other treatments can help you manage the symptoms in specific parts of your body. GVHD usually goes away a year or so after the transplant, when your body starts to make its own white blood cells from the donor cells. But some people have to manage it for many years.If you've had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, you'll want to watch for signs of graft versus host disease (GVHD). It's a common complication -- as many as 4 out of 5 people who get a transplant get it in some form.  It happens when the cells that come from a donor mistakenly attack your own cells. Its effects can range from mild to life-threatening. A mild case of GVHD can be a good sign. If the donor immune cells attack your healthy cells, they're also fighting any leftover cancer cells.

They can clear the rash, control the cancer, and get rid of the itch. Phototherapy: This uses ultraviolet light rays to heal the skin. Sometimes, you take a drug beforehand that makes T-cells more sensitive to the light. Radiation: Electron beam radiation works well against mycosis fungoides. It uses very tiny electrically charged particles (electrons) to target and kill cancer cells. This type of radiation only enters the upper layers of your skin, so deeper tissues and organs are safe. It's given in two ways:If your cancer is more advanced, your doctor may suggest whole body therapies. These include: Chemotherapy: Strong drugs target cancer and other cells that divide quickly. Targeted and biologic therapy: Some drugs identify and attack specific parts of cancer cells. Others boost your immune system to fight them. Retinoid pills: These change the way cancer cells grow and mature. Photopheresis: This therapy uses ultraviolet light to treat cancerous cells in your blood. It's like giving blood, but instead of it going into a collection bag, blood goes into a special machine that takes out T-cells. They're treated with a drug and then exposed to the UV rays. The cells are mixed back in with the rest of your blood and returned to your body. This usually is used to treat advanced cases of mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Doctors think it works by killing some cancer cells and by boosting your body's immune attack against other ones."
Grave's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/women/understanding-graves-disease-basics,"Graves’ disease is an autoimmune condition that causes your thyroid to become hyperactive -- work harder than it needs to. It is one of the most common thyroid problems and the leading cause of hyperthyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too many hormones. It was named after the man who first described it in the early 19th century, Sir Robert Graves. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland that sits in the front of your neck and releases hormones that help regulate your metabolism. When you have Graves’ disease, your immune system attacks your thyroid, causing it to overproduce those hormones, which causes a number of problems in different parts of your body. It usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50 and is more common in women.  Once the disorder has been correctly diagnosed, it is quite easy to treat. In some cases, Graves' disease goes into remission or disappears completely after several months or years. Left untreated, however, it can lead to serious complications -- even death. ","The most common symptoms of Graves’ are symptoms of hyperthyroidism, which include: Nervousness, anxiety or irritability Tired or weak muscles Shaking in your hands Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea Difficulty sleeping Greater sensitivity to heat or increase sweating Unintentional weight loss An enlarged thyroid (also called a goiter) A fast or irregular heartbeat Changes in your period for women Erectile dysfunction in men Loss of sex drive (low libido)","Hormones secreted by the  thyroid gland control metabolism, or the speed at which the body converts food into energy. Metabolism is directly linked to the amount of hormones that circulate in the bloodstream. If, for some reason, the thyroid gland secretes too much of these hormones, the body's metabolism kicks into high gear, causing a pounding heart, sweating, trembling, and weight loss. Normally, the thyroid gets its production orders through another chemical called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), released by the pituitary gland in the brain. But in Graves' disease, a malfunction in the body's immune system releases abnormal antibodies that act like TSH. Spurred by these false signals to produce, the thyroid's hormone factories work overtime and overproduce. Exactly why the immune system begins to produce these troublesome antibodies isn’t clear. Heredity and other characteristics seem to play a role. Studies show, for example, that if one identical twin contracts Graves' disease, there is a 20% likelihood that the other twin will get it too. Also, women are more likely than men to develop the disease. And smokers who develop Graves' disease are more prone to eye problems than nonsmokers with the disease. No single gene causes Graves’ disease. It is thought to be triggered by both genetics and environmental factors.","If you have symptoms or signs of the complications of Graves’ disease, your doctor will probably ask you if you have a family history of the condition and order one or more of the following tests: A blood test to check your levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and other thyroid hormones. With Graves’ disease your TSH levels are usually suppressed and your other hormones are elevated.  Lab tests to look for the antibodies that cause Graves’s disease. If you don’t have them, that’s a sign that your hyperthyroidism is caused by something else.  A radioactive iodine uptake test that uses small doses of radioactive iodine to watch how much of it is taken up into your thyroid from your bloodstream. Your body normally uses iodine to make thyroid hormones, so if it takes in a lot of the radioactive iodine it is a sign that it is working harder than it needs to.  A thyroid scan to see where the radioactive iodine travels in your thyroid gland. If it goes all over your thyroid, that suggests you have Graves’ disease, because with other causes of hypothyroidism, only some parts of the gland are involved. ","There are two goals in the treatment for Graves’ disease. One is to stop your thyroid gland from overproducing thyroid hormone. The other is to stop the increased levels of thyroid hormone from causing problems in your body. There are a number of treatment options to achieve one or both of these goals. Radioactive iodine therapy With this treatment, you take another form of radioactive iodine by mouth than what is used in the test to diagnose Graves’ disease. The iodine gets into your thyroid and the radiation kills some of the cells in your thyroid that are overproducing thyroid hormones. It’s possible that this treatment could make any eye problems you have from Graves’ disease temporarily worse and it’s also likely it will lead to a lower production of thyroid hormone than is healthy. If that happens, your low thyroid can be treated. Because this treatment uses radiation, it’s not used on pregnant or breastfeeding women. "

In fact, the pituitary has been called the “master gland” because its hormones help control other hormones. It’s part of what’s called the endocrine system, which oversees many body functions. But if too much or too little GH is in your body, there may be something wrong with your pituitary gland. In children, you may find this out during a visit with your pediatrician. During a typical visit, your pediatrician will likely check your child for height, weight, and head size and see how they compare with the normal range for children of that age. If the measurements are outside that range, they may order tests. If you’re an adult, you may want to visit your doctor if your symptoms include:There are many different possible causes for these symptoms, but they may also signal issues with GH production. A test can measure the amount of GH in your blood. Your pituitary gland releases GH in pulses that vary by sex, age, and even time of day. That is why doctors use different methods to stimulate or suppress the release of growth hormone before you take the test.",,,"For your child, the test begins with a technician placing an IV line in their arm or hand.After giving a blood sample, your child will get a dose of medicine or medicines to stimulate the pituitary gland to release growth hormone.

It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn't have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks.

Gunther Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/porphyria-symptoms-causes-treatment,"Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems. There's no cure, but you can get treatments that will help you manage your symptoms. If you have porphyria that affects your skin, you'll hear your doctor call it a ""cutaneous porphyria."" When the condition causes a problem with your nervous system, it's called ""acute porphyria.""","Symptoms are different depending on the type of porphyria. Symptoms of acute porphyria The symptoms of acute porphyria can develop quickly and last for days or weeks. You might have an imbalance of salt in your body along with this type of porphyria.The symptoms can include: You may notice changes in your personality, or you may get depression or other mental disorders. You could also feel agitated, confused, or get seizures. Some complications you could get are: Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria Symptoms of cutaneous porphyria happen when your skin is in sunlight. The most commonly affected areas include the face and the back of the: You may get symptoms on your skin such as:  ","No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn't have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria. These triggers can be things like: Episodes of acute porphyria, which rarely happen before puberty, can be set off by taking some kinds of drugs, including: Other things that might trigger acute porphyria are:  ","Doctors sometimes find it tricky to diagnose porphyria because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. If your doctor thinks you have it, they may order blood, urine, and stool tests to get a diagnosis. The best time for you to do these tests is when you have an outbreak of symptoms or around that time.Sometimes you'll get multiple tests to help your doctor figure out which specific type of porphyria you have. Your doctor may also suggest you get a genetic test. Since porphyria often runs in families, your doctor may recommend that others in your family get this test as well. Questions for your doctor  ","When you have an outbreak of acute porphyria symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. You'll get medicine for pain, nausea, and vomiting. Your doctor may prescribe givosiran (Givlaari), which helps reduce the toxins linked to the attacks. You may also need to get a type of sugar called glucose, which you might take by mouth or get put into your veins through an IV. Your doctor may also give you a shot of hemin (Panhematin).If you have cutaneous porphyria, your treatment will depend on the specific type of the disease you have and how severe your symptoms are. If you have porphyria cutanea tarda, your treatment might include: Your doctor may suggest that you avoid anything that triggers an outbreak. They will also treat conditions you have that bring on porphyria, like HIV or hepatitis C. Doctors for porphyria There are many things you can do to prevent outbreaks and manage your symptoms. You will likely need care from a team of health care professionals. You might see: It may take time to find the right doctors, because porphyria is so rare. The American Porphyria Foundation (APF) can help you find a specialist in your area. Good nutrition is another important part of taking care of yourself when you have porphyria. Your doctor or dietitian will help you get the right balance of carbohydrates and nutrients in your meals."
"Guttate Scleroderma, Lichen Sclerosus Type",https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/lichen-sclerosis,"Doctors don’t know why some people get lichen sclerosus. They think it may be due to genes, hormones, an infection, or some combination of these things. Another theory is that your immune system attacks your skin. It may even be caused by an old skin injury.","If you have it, you may notice small, shiny, and smooth white patches on your skin. These patches can become bigger and the skin may become thin and wrinkled. Your skin may tear easily, causing large bruises (which may be red or purple) to appear. Itching is very common. So are scarring, bleeding, or blistering. But some people may not have any symptoms at all.","Doctors don’t know why some people get lichen sclerosus.

That means they will remove a small piece of your skin and send it to a lab to be viewed under a microscope. This will confirm or rule out the diagnosis.","Although there’s no cure for lichen sclerosus, there are treatments that can help. If you have it on your genitals, you should get it treated, even if you don’t have symptoms. When left untreated, it can lead to problems with sex or urination. Patches on other parts of the body usually go away with time.Your doctor will probably first give you a steroid cream to put on the problem area. This can stop the itching. But it may take longer -- a few weeks or months --for the skin to return to a more normal appearance. You may need to use these creams or ointments for a long period of time to keep the condition from coming back. You’ll need to keep up with your doctor appointments, since long-term use of steroid creams or ointments can make the skin become red or thin and cause stretch marks. The treatment can also cause genital yeast infections. If the cortisone cream or ointment doesn’t work for you, there are other treatment options. They include vitamin A-like drugs called retinoids, ultraviolet light therapy, or tacrolimus ointment. Tacrolimus ointment, as well as one called pimecrolimus ointment, are creams that help your immune system recognize lichen sclerosus as an invader."
GVHD,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/graft-versus-host-disease,"GVHD can show up in several different parts of your body. Usually, it affects your skin, digestive system, or liver. It often starts as an itchy rash on your palms and the soles of your feet. You may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some of these symptoms can be side effects of the transplant or of procedures or medications that go along with it. They can also mean you have an infection. Your doctor may take a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, from the affected part of your body to find out. A specialist will look for signs of GVHD in the sample under a microscope.There are two main types, based on when symptoms show up. Acute GVHD usually happens within 100 days of the transplant. Chronic GVHD usually appears later. You're more likely to get the chronic form if you've had the acute form, and sometimes the two happen at the same time. Beyond the timing, differences in symptoms help determine what kind you have. With acute GVHD, you may have: A rash and digestive problems are also symptoms of chronic GVHD.

A transplant of someone else's bone marrow or stem cells lets your body make new blood cells. But with GVHD, donor immune cells can attack your healthy cells as if they were bacteria or a virus. You're most likely to get it if your proteins which protect your body's cells don't match your donor's very well. Other things that can increase your risk include: The more closely your cells match those of your donor, the better. Unless you have an identical twin, your best match will be a sibling or parent. But you may find a good match in a national registry. The risk also goes down if doctors get the donor cells from umbilical cord blood rather than peripheral blood or bone marrow. Certain medications taken before and after the transplant can help prevent GVHD. You'll get a combination of drugs that slow down your immune system to keep the new white blood cells from going on the attack.",,"If your GVHD is severe enough to need treatment, your doctor probably will prescribe a combination of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and drugs that slow down your immune system, such as cyclosporine. Those can make it harder for your body to fight infections, so you may also get prophylactic antibiotics. If the problem persists, your doctor may prescribe a kinase inhibitor. Other treatments can help you manage the symptoms in specific parts of your body. GVHD usually goes away a year or so after the transplant, when your body starts to make its own white blood cells from the donor cells. But some people have to manage it for many years.If you've had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, you'll want to watch for signs of graft versus host disease (GVHD). It's a common complication -- as many as 4 out of 5 people who get a transplant get it in some form.  It happens when the cells that come from a donor mistakenly attack your own cells. Its effects can range from mild to life-threatening. A mild case of GVHD can be a good sign. If the donor immune cells attack your healthy cells, they're also fighting any leftover cancer cells. Your doctor may decide it's best not to treat it."
Gynecomastia,https://www.webmd.com/men/what-is-gynecomastia,"Gynecomastia is a condition that makes breast tissue swell in boys and men. It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called ""pseudogynecomastia."" Although breasts don't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue. Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone, which guides their sexual growth during puberty. But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls. When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes. Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree.","Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore. This might make you worry that you have breast cancer, which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer, but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out. Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness. See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts.","A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known. In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are:Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies. Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as: Anti-androgens. These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer. Anabolic steroids and androgens. Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions. HIV drugs. Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called ""highly active antiretroviral therapy."" Anti-anxiety drugs. Medicines such as diazepam (Valium) can sometimes cause gynecomastia. Heart medications. Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes. Medicines used to empty your stomach. For example, metoclopramide (Reglan) can have gynecomastia as a side effect. Ulcer drugs. Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB). Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments.","If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer. They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include: You might also be given tests. They could include:","Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment. When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist, who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body. How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs. If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition. You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth. In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as:"
H. Pylori,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/h-pylori-helicobacter-pylori,"For decades, doctors thought people got ulcers from stress, spicy foods, smoking, or other lifestyle habits. But when scientists discovered H. pylori in 1982, they found that the germs were the cause of most stomach ulcers.After H. pylori enters your body, it attacks the lining of your stomach, which usually protects you from the acid your body uses to digest food. Once the bacteria have done enough damage, acid can get through the lining, which leads to ulcers. These may bleed, cause infections, or keep food from moving through your digestive tract. You can get H. pylori from food, water, or utensils. It’s more common in countries or communities that lack clean water or good sewage systems. You can also pick up the bacteria through contact with the saliva or other body fluids of infected people. Many people get H. pylori during childhood, but adults can get it, too. The germs live in the body for years before symptoms start, but most people who have it will never get ulcers. Doctors aren’t sure why only some people get ulcers after an infection.","If you have an ulcer, you may feel a dull or burning pain in your belly. It may come and go, but you’ll probably feel it most when your stomach is empty, such as between meals or in the middle of the night. It can last for a few minutes or for hours. You may feel better after you eat, drink milk, or take an antacid.Other signs of an ulcer include: Ulcers can bleed into your stomach or intestines, which can be dangerous to your health.

Over time, you may notice:",,"If you don’t have symptoms of an ulcer, your doctor probably won’t test you for H. pylori. But if you have them now or have in the past, it’s best to get tested. Medicines like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also damage your stomach lining, so it’s important to find out what’s causing your symptoms so you can get the right treatment.To start, your doctor will ask you about your medical history, your symptoms, and any medicines you take. Then they’ll give you a physical exam, including pressing on your belly to check for swelling, tenderness, or pain. You may also have: To look more closely at your ulcers, your doctor may use: If you have H. pylori, your doctor may also test you for stomach cancer. This includes:","If you have ulcers caused by H. pylori, you’ll need treatment to kill the germs, heal your stomach lining, and keep the sores from coming back. It usually takes 1 to 2 weeks of treatment to get better. Your doctor will probably tell you to take a few different types of drugs. The options include:Your treatment could mean you’ll take 14 or more pills per day for a few weeks, which seems like a lot of medicine. But it’s really important to take everything that your doctor prescribes and to follow their instructions. If you don’t take antibiotics the right way, bacteria in your body can become resistant to them, which makes infections harder to treat. If your medications bother you, talk to your doctor about your treatment options and how you can handle side effects. About 1-2 weeks after you finish your treatment, your doctor may test your breath or stool again to make sure the infection is gone."

Symptoms can include:","Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes.","Your doctor will order blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies. You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems.","The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes. Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You’ll need to take medicine for the rest of your life. Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine. You should also let your doctor know if you take:Your thyroid is a small gland in front of your neck that makes hormones that help control just about every organ. When your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight. If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis. Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease."

Although the problem usually goes away, as many as 20% of these women develop Hashimoto's years later.Excessive iodine. Research suggests certain drugs and too much iodine, a trace element required by your body to make thyroid hormones, may trigger thyroid disease in susceptible people. Radiation exposure. Increased cases of thyroid disease have been reported in people exposed to radiation, including the atomic bombs in Japan, the Chernobyl nuclear accident, and radiation treatment for a form of blood cancer called Hodgkin's disease.","Hashimoto's symptoms may be mild at first or take years to develop. The first sign of the disease is often an enlarged thyroid, called a goiter. The goiter may cause the front of your neck to look swollen. A large goiter may make swallowing difficult.

The pills are available in several different strengths. The exact dose your doctor prescribes will depend on a number of factors, including: Once you start treatment, your doctor will order a lab test called a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test to monitor thyroid function and help ensure you are getting the right dose. Because thyroid hormones act very slowly in the body, it may take a few months for symptoms to go away and your goiter to shrink. However, large goiters that do not improve may make it necessary to remove the thyroid gland.Also called Hashimoto's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease, a disorder in which the immune system turns against the body's own tissues. In people with Hashimoto's, the immune system attacks the thyroid. This can lead to hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid does not make enough hormones for the body's needs. Located in the front of your neck, the thyroid gland makes hormones that control metabolism. This includes your heart rate and how quickly your body uses calories from the foods you eat.  "
Hay Fever,https://www.webmd.com/allergies/understanding-hay-fever-basics,"  Hay fever is an allergic reaction to certain things. Common triggers include pollen, ragweed, and cats. Also known as allergic rhinitis, there are two types: seasonal, which happens only during the time of year in which certain plants pollinate, and perennial, which happens year-round. Typically, if you suffer from hay fever in the spring, you're probably allergic to tree pollens. Grass and weed pollens may be causing your allergic reaction during the summer. In autumn, ragweed pollen may plague you, and fungus spores cause problems primarily from late March through November but can be present year round. People with year-round (perennial) hay fever are usually allergic to one or more allergens found indoors. These include house dust mites, feathers, and animal dander (the tiny skin flakes animals such as cats and dogs shed along with fur), all of which may be found in pillows, and bedding, heavy draperies, upholstery, and carpeting. Another common allergen, mold, is usually found in damp areas such as bathrooms and basements.",,"If you have hay fever (allergic rhinitis), it's because your immune system views harmless inhaled pollen or other allergens as dangerous substances invading the body. Your system overreacts, flooding your bloodstream with chemicals like histamine and leukotrienes, which inflame the lining of your nasal passages, sinuses, and eyelids and also set in motion other symptoms associated with hay fever, such as: All of these symptoms are meant to protect your body either by trapping and expelling the allergen or by swelling body areas, such as the nasal passages, so the allergen can't enter. As a result of congestion in the veins in the lining of your sinuses, dark circles, commonly known as allergic shiners, may appear under your eyes. If you have perennial allergic rhinitis, they may be present all year round. The swelling of your nasal membranes may also close the sinus drainage openings, causing sinusitis. Rhinitis may also be associated with nasal polyps -- small, non-cancerous growths; nosebleeds can also occur during hay fever attacks. Hay fever is often an inherited trait (genetically determined). Most people with hay fever have a parent or sibling who also has allergies. People with asthma or eczema (allergic dermatitis) are more likely than others to develop hay fever; and about one-third of those with allergic rhinitis also have at least mild, intermittent, allergic asthma.",,
HD,https://www.webmd.com/brain/hungtingtons-disease-causes-symptoms-treatment,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and deadly disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. This causes physical and mental abilities to weaken, and they get worse over time. There is no cure. If it starts early in life, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s disease. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease may come as quite a shock. There's a lot to take in. But tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can make the journey a bit less daunting. With the help of a healthcare team, people with Huntington's can live independently for many years.","  Although symptoms may first show up in midlife, Huntington's can strike anyone from childhood to advanced age. Symptoms often first appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. Over 10 to 25 years, the disease gradually kills nerve cells in the brain. This affects the body, mind, and emotions. If symptoms begin before age 20, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s Disease and it may get worse faster.Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. And stress or excitement can worsen symptoms. Some symptoms are easier to spot than others. Abnormal movements may be the first thing you notice. Weight loss can be a concern at all stages. Symptoms of Huntington's disease tend to develop in stages. Early stage symptoms Changes may be quite subtle in early stages, making it possible to keep driving and working. You may just require a little extra help. Common early symptoms include: Trouble learning new things Trouble making decisions Memory lapses Mood swings Clumsiness Slow or abnormal eye movements Muscle problems (dystonia) Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Loss of energy and fatigue   Middle stage symptoms With time, symptoms begin to interfere more with your day-to-day life. For example, you might start to drop things or to fall. Or you may have trouble speaking or swallowing. Staying organized may be difficult. And emotional changes may put pressure on relationships. Common middle stage symptoms include: Uncontrolled twitching movements (chorea) Trouble walking Confusion Memory loss Personality changes Speech changes Decline in thinking abilities Swallowing problems Breathing problems Thoughts of death, dying, or suicide Weight loss Development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, or mania ","In 1993, researchers found the gene that causes Huntington's. Everyone has the HD gene, but in some families an abnormal copy of the gene gets passed from parent to child. If you have a parent with Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of having the gene and developing the disease. Also: Men and women are equally likely to inherit the abnormal gene. If you don't have the abnormal gene, you can't get Huntington's or pass it on to your children. The disease doesn't skip generations. If you or members of your family plan to be tested for Huntington's, it's a good idea to get professional genetic counseling first. Counselors can help explain what to expect from the test results. With knowledge about the HD gene, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about how the disease affects the brain. More importantly, this discovery may help pave the way for future treatment.",,"  For now, treating Huntington's involves managing symptoms: Medications can help control fidgety movements. Your doctor can work closely with you to manage any side effects and to change medications, if needed. Some antipsychotic drugs have a side effect that controls movement and have been helpful for some people. Antidepressants can also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders, but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.  Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family. Family members can help by making some changes at home: Serve extra meals and add high-calorie supplements to help you stay at a healthy weight. Limit distractions during meal times.  Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and at stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication."

Healing Touch,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-management-alternative-therapy,"Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind’s ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches, including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain.Visualization, also known as guided visualization, may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body.",,,,"Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or consuming plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not randomized and was without a control group. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis. Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment."

Hemophilia A,https://www.webmd.com/children/hemophilia-a,"Hemophilia A is a condition that keeps your blood from clotting the way it should. That means your body has problems stopping bleeding, both outside and inside your body. Your condition can be treated, and in some cases you can give yourself the treatment at home. You can lead a full life when you have the right treatment plan in place. There are different types of hemophilia. With hemophilia A, your body doesn't have enough of a protein called factor VIII, which it needs to make clots and stop bleeding. Hemophilia A can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how little you have of factor VIII. More than half of those with the condition have the severe form. Hemophilia A usually runs in families, but about one-third of people with the disease don't have a family history of it.","The symptoms of hemophilia A depend on whether you have a mild, moderate, or severe case. Mild hemophilia A. If you're in this group, you may have an episode of heavy bleeding:Some people don't get a diagnosis until after one of these things happens to them when they're adults. Moderate hemophilia A. Moderate hemophilia usually means you: Severe hemophilia A. In addition to bleeding after an injury, you may have frequent episodes of bleeding, often into the joints and muscles, without being able to figure out a specific cause. When you have severe hemophilia A, bleeding can also happen in your brain. It’s rare, but if you have a head bump -- even if it's minor -- and you have any of these symptoms, call your doctor:  ","Hemophilia A comes from your genes. You can inherit it from your parents. Or it can happen if a certain gene changes before you're born. This change is called a spontaneous mutation.The hemophilia A gene mutation happens on the X chromosome. Women get one X chromosome from their mother and one from their father. Men get an X from their mother and a Y from their father. Most women with the problem gene are carriers and have no symptoms, but they can pass it to their sons. Therefore the disease nearly always shows up in boys, not girls. A rare type of hemophilia A is acquired hemophilia. It’s most common in people 60 to 80 years of age. If you have this kind, your immune system attacks healthy tissue called clotting factors in your blood. Acquired hemophilia tends to happen alongside these conditions:  ","If you have a family history of hemophilia and are pregnant, tests can tell if your baby has the disease. There are risks though, so you’ll want to talk to your doctor about testing.In children, doctors usually diagnose severe cases in the first year of a baby’s life. Does your child bruise easily or bleed for longer than normal from small injuries? Make an appointment with your child's doctor. They can tell if it's hemophilia. It's unusual for a baby younger than 6 months old to be diagnosed with hemophilia. That's because infants this young usually don't do things that would make them bleed. Once a baby starts moving, crawling, and bumping into things, you may notice raised bruises, especially on places like the stomach, chest, back, and bottom. The doctor may ask: The doctor may also do blood tests like these, or they may send you to a specialist called a hematologist for them:  ","Some new treatments are in clinical trials. If they're approved, they could help you manage your disease with fewer injections. Some might even cure hemophilia A. One of the most promising treatments in the pipeline is gene therapy. It uses a virus to deliver a normal copy of the mutated gene to your liver cells. The virus is changed first so that it can't make you sick. Once the new gene is inside your liver, it tells your cells to make factor VIII. With gene therapy, you only need one treatment to fix the problem. Gene editing is another hemophilia treatment that researchers are studying. It removes or fixes the faulty parts of the gene so that it can tell your body to make the right protein. Scientists are also looking into cell therapy. It changes liver cells in a lab to make them produce clotting factors. When those cells go into your body, they keep making the clotting factors you need. Other new treatments in the works could help factor replacement therapy last longer. These treatments could prevent bleeding with fewer injections."
Hemophilia B,https://www.webmd.com/children/hemophilia-b-medref,"If your child has hemophilia, their blood doesn't clot like it should.

With the right treatment, though, and by avoiding certain risks, your child can have an active life. People with hemophilia don’t have enough of a protein that helps blood clot. There are two main types of the condition: A and B. Your child's type depends on which protein, or clotting factor, they lack. There are 13 of these clotting factors in our blood. With hemophilia B, you don't have enough factor IX. More than half the people with it have a severe case; they have almost no factor IX in their blood. Diagnosis usually comes in early childhood. Only about 2 in 10 people who have hemophilia have this type. It happens more in boys than girls.","The two main symptoms are bleeding for longer than normal, and bruising easily. Your child may have: If your child has a muscle or joint that is bleeding, it can hurt, especially when they move it. Usually it's swollen and hot to the touch. With this disease, even a small bump to the head can be serious. If it happens, get emergency medical help for any of these signs of bleeding in the brain:","Most people inherit it from their mother, who carries a faulty gene. But it can also happen when a gene changes (mutates) before birth.","In the first 6 months of life, babies don’t fall or get hurt often, so an early diagnosis is rare. You may start noticing issues once your baby becomes more active. As they begin to crawl, they may get bumps and raised bruises. There may be bleeding in the joints. Bruising and long-lasting bleeding from even small injuries may cause a doctor to suspect hemophilia.The doctor may ask: Your doctor will also ask about your family’s medical history to find out if anyone had a problem with bleeding or blood clotting. To get the diagnosis, doctors will test your child's blood to find out how long it takes to clot and to see if it's missing any clotting factors. This often includes:","There is no cure, but you can manage the condition, and your child can enjoy an active life. They can get the factor IX their body doesn't make. This is called replacement therapy. With this treatment, doctors use a needle to put clotting factor IX into the bloodstream. The replacement protein can come from human blood, or it's made in a lab.If your child has severe hemophilia, they may need regular treatments to prevent bleeding. If they don't, they may need only treatment to stop bleeding after it starts. You can get replacement therapy at a clinic or from a visiting nurse, or you can learn to do it at home. There are newer treatments that range from helping your body create more clotting factors, preventing clots from breaking down, to sealants that can be applied directly to wound sites to promote clotting and healing. "

Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (HSP),https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/henoch-schonlein-purpura-causes-symptoms-treatment,"The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.","The classic symptoms of HSP are rash, joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain, and/or related kidney disease, including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain, lungs, or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP:Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises. The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis. Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles. It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.","The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved.

A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.","The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present.

In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications."
Hepatocellular Carcinoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/hepatocellular-carcinoma,"Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer that starts in your liver. It's different from ""secondary"" liver cancers, which have spread to the liver from other organs. If caught early, it can sometimes be cured with surgery or transplant. In more advanced cases it can’t be cured, but treatment and support can help you live longer and better.  It's important to remember that you still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. Make sure you have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. Ask your doctor about support groups, where you can meet people who know what you're going through. Your doctor can help you understand your treatment options. Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and target therapy may be some of your choices.","You might not have any symptoms when hepatocellular carcinoma is in an early stage. As the cancer grows, you may have one or more of these:","Doctors aren't sure exactly what causes all cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, but they've identified some things that may increase your risk for getting it:Hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Hepatocellular cancer can start many years after you've had one of these liver infections. Both are passed through blood, such as when drug users share needles. Blood tests can show whether you have hepatitis B or C. Cirrhosis. This serious disease happens when liver cells are damaged and replaced with scar tissue. Many things can cause it: hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol drinking, certain drugs, and too much iron stored in the liver. Heavy drinking. Having more than two alcoholic drinks a day for many years raises your risk of hepatocellular cancer. The more you drink, the higher your risk. Obesity and diabetes. Both conditions raise your risk of liver cancer. Obesity can lead to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. The higher risk from diabetes may be due to liver damage caused by the disease. Plus, people with diabetes are often overweight or obese. Anabolic steroids. Drugs that mimic the male sex hormone testosterone are sometimes used by athletes to build muscle mass. Long-term use increases your risk.","Your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions like:Your doctor may use tests to help diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma: Blood test. Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and checks to see if it has a protein called AFP. :  Unborn babies have high levels of AFP, but it decreases in most people right after birth. If your blood has a high amount of AFP, it could be a sign of liver cancer. Imaging tests. Your doctor may ask you to get an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to look for tumors in your liver. An ultrasound creates images of your liver with sound waves. A CT scan is a powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures inside your body. An MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to make an image of your liver. Liver biopsy. Your doctor may want to remove a sample of your liver tissue and check it under a microscope for cancer cells. This can be done several ways. In one method, your doctor removes some liver tissue with a needle that they place through your skin and into your liver. They numb the area first so you won't feel pain. Your doctor may also do a biopsy by making a small cut in your belly and putting a needle into the liver to pull out a sample of tissue. You'll get anesthesia first, so you won't be awake while this is going on.","There are many treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma. It's a big decision, so work closely with your doctor to make the right plan for you. Your choices may include: Radiation. This uses high-energy rays to kill your cancer cells. Two types of radiation therapy can treat hepatocellular carcinoma: Radiation therapy can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting, or tiredness, but these symptoms go away when treatment is done. Chemotherapy. To treat cancer, doctors often place chemotherapy drugs directly into your liver. It's a process called ""chemoembolization.""Your doctor puts a thin, flexible tube into the artery that supplies blood to your liver. The tube delivers a chemo drug combined with another drug that helps to block the artery. The goal is to kill the tumor by starving it of blood. Your liver still gets the blood it needs through another blood vessel. You usually get chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, which means you don't need to stay overnight in a hospital. It can cause side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, pain, fever and chills, headache, and weakness. You may also be more likely to get infections, bruising, bleeding, and fatigue. Medicine can ease some of these side effects. Alcohol injection. This is also called ""percutaneous ethanol injection."" An ultrasound, which uses sound waves to see structures in your body, helps your doctor guide a thin needle into the tumor. Then they inject ethanol (alcohol) to destroy the cancer. You usually have this procedure under local anesthesia, which means you won't feel pain but you're awake while this is going on."

Hereditary Nonspherocytic Hemolytic Anemia (HNHA),https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia,"Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem.","Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have:  Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice:","You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus. Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are:  ","If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll  also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC, to look for signs of anemia. This test measures:A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these:","If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids, such as hydrocortisone or prednisone, to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place.  Other medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion.Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia. When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath."

Hiatal Hernia,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/hiatal-hernia,"A hiatal hernia is when your stomach bulges up into your chest through an opening in your diaphragm, the muscle that separates the two areas. The opening is called the hiatus, so this condition is also called a hiatus hernia. There are two main types of hiatal hernias: sliding and paraesophageal. Ordinarily, your esophagus (food pipe) goes through the hiatus and attaches to your stomach. In a sliding hiatal hernia, your stomach and the lower part of your esophagus slide up into your chest through the diaphragm. Most people with hiatal hernias have this type. A paraesophageal hernia is more dangerous. Your esophagus and stomach stay where they should be, but part of your stomach squeezes through the hiatus to sit next to your esophagus. Your stomach can become squeezed and lose its blood supply. Your doctor might call this a strangulated hernia.  ","Many people with hiatal hernia don’t notice any symptoms. Others may have: Get medical care right away if you have a hiatal hernia and: These could be signs of a strangulated hernia or an obstruction, which are medical emergencies.","Hiatal hernias happen more often in women, people who are overweight, and people older than 50.","To diagnose a hiatal hernia, your doctor may do tests including: If anemia is a concern, your doctor may take a blood sample to check your red blood cell count.","Most people don’t notice symptoms of a hiatal hernia and don’t need treatment. If you have acid reflux, your doctor may suggest medications to treat those symptoms, including:Your doctor might do surgery if you have a paraesophageal hernia (when part of your stomach squeezes through the hiatus) so your stomach doesn’t become strangled. You may also need surgery if sliding hernias bleed or become large, strangulated, or inflamed. In surgery, your doctor reinforces your hiatus and moves your stomach. Many hiatal hernia surgeries use a method called laparoscopy. Your doctor will make a few small (5 to 10 millimeter) cuts in your belly. They insert a tool called a laparoscope through these incisions, and it sends pictures to a monitor so your doctor can see inside your body. These “minimally invasive” procedures have smaller cuts, less risk of infection, less pain and scarring, and faster recovery than traditional surgeries. You can probably go back to regular activity in 2 weeks."

Hidradenitis Suppurativa,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/hidradenitis-suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory condition that causes painful bumps under your skin in the hair roots and/or near some of your sweat glands. It’s also known as acne inversa. The bumps can get infected. When that happens, pockets form under your skin and fill with pus. They can smell bad when they break open. They can also leave scars. There's no cure for HS, but treatments and lifestyle changes can bring some relief and cut down on flare-ups. Because this condition lasts a long time, it can be frustrating, and it can take an emotional toll on you. Make sure you get the support you need.","HS usually affects both sides of your body. You can get the bumps in one place or in several areas at once. The first warning sign might be a single painful bump that gets inflamed. It can last days or months. You could have repeated outbreaks of a single bump in the same location or the same general area. Besides turning into pockets of pus, the bumps can be itchy. Your skin might have small pitted areas with blackheads. Some people get tunnels under their skin, called sinus tracts, which connect different areas of HS outbreaks. The bumps and leaky pockets can go away and come back. In severe cases, they don't fully heal.","  Doctors aren't sure what causes hidradenitis suppurativa, but it’s probably due to a combination of genes, hormones, and the environment.  It's more common in women than in men. It’s also more likely if you’re overweight, if you smoke, and if you’ve had acne. About a third of people who get HS have a relative with it.The skin problems start when hair follicles get blocked. You often get the first symptoms in your teens or 20s. You don’t get HS because you don’t wash enough, because you use deodorants or powders, or because you shave your underarms. You also can't catch it from someone else or give it to another person.","Your doctor will check your skin and make a diagnosis based on where the bumps and pockets are and how often you have them. They may also ask you things like: You probably won’t have tests unless your doctor needs to rule out other kinds of infections. Then, they’ll take a sample of pus and send it to a lab for testing.","Your treatment will be based on how severe your case is. You and your doctor might have to try multiple treatments to find the one that works best for you. Treatments include: Warm compresses. You might try this first if your case is mild. Run a clean washcloth under hot water and hold it on your skin for 10 minutes. NSAIDs(nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

If your cholesterol level is too high, cholesterol can build up in the walls of your arteries. Over time, this buildup -- called plaque -- causes hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis. Arteries that feed the heart can narrow in certain areas (focal narrowing) and slow blood flow to part of the heart muscle. Or cholesterol plaques break off and float to smaller blood vessels and cause a partial or total blockage. Sometimes inflammatory cells might go to the broken plaque area and cause a narrowing there as well. Reduced blood flow can result in chest pain called angina, or in a heart attack if a blood vessel gets blocked completely. ",,A few simple changes can lower your cholesterol and cut your risk for conditions linked to high cholesterol.,,

Hirschsprung's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-hirschsprungs-disease,"It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy. Usually, as the baby develops, nerve cells are created throughout the entire digestive system, from the esophagus -- which leads from the mouth to the stomach -- all the way to the rectum. Normally, a person will have up to 500 million of these types of nerve cells. Among other roles, they move food through your digestive system from one end to the other. In a baby with Hirschsprung’s, the nerve cells stop growing at the end of the large intestine, just before the rectum and anus. In some children, the cells are missing at other places in the digestive system as well. That means the body can’t sense when waste material reaches a certain point. So the waste material gets stuck and forms a block in the system. Hirschsprung’s disease affects about one in every 5,000 newborns. Children with other congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome and heart defects, are more likely to have the disease. Parents who carry the code for Hirschsprung’s disease in their genes, especially mothers, may pass it on to their children. Boys get it more than girls. The disease is named after the 19th-century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888.","For the vast majority of people with Hirschsprung’s disease, symptoms usually begin within the first 6 weeks of life. In many cases, there are signs within the first 48 hours. You may see swelling in your child’s abdomen. Other symptoms you might see include: No bowel movements: You should be concerned if the newborn does not produce a stool or the meconium in the first couple of days. Older children with Hirschsprung’s may have chronic (ongoing) constipation. Bloody diarrhea: Children with Hirschsprung’s may also get enterocolitis, a life-threatening infection of the colon, and have bad cases of diarrhea and gas. Vomiting: The vomit may be green or brown. In older children, symptoms may include growth issues, fatigue, and severe constipation.","It begins to take hold in a baby in the early months of pregnancy.

The disease is named after the 19th-century Danish doctor Harald Hirschsprung, who described the condition in 1888.","Your doctor should be told at once if your child has these symptoms. They can confirm Hirschsprung’s with some specific tests: A contrast enema: It’s also called a barium enema, after the element in the dye often used to coat and highlight the inside of the body’s organs. Your child is placed face-down on a table while the dye is inserted via a tube from the anus into the intestines. No anesthesia (a medication to numb or block pain) is necessary. The dye allows the doctor to see problem areas on the X-rays.The contrast enema is done as part of what is called a “lower GI series,” a group of tests on the gastrointestinal tract. An abdominal X-ray: This is a standard X-ray, which the technician may take from several angles. Your doctor will be able to see whether something is blocking the intestines. A biopsy: Your doctor will take a small sample of tissue from your child’s rectum. The tissue will be looked at for signs of Hirschsprung’s. Depending on the age and size of your child, the doctor may use anesthesia. Anorectal manometry: This test inflates a small balloon inside the rectum to see whether the muscles of the area respond. This test is done only on older children.","Hirschsprung’s disease is a very serious condition. But if found quickly, it can help your child live a relatively normal life. Doctors will usually do one of two types of surgery: Pull-through procedure: This surgery simply cuts out the part of the large intestine with the missing nerve cells. Then the rest of the intestine is connected directly to the anus.Ostomy surgery: This surgery routes the intestine to an opening made in the body. The doctor then attaches an ostomy bag to the outside of the opening to hold the waste from the intestine. Ostomy surgery is usually a temporary measure until the child is ready for the pull-through procedure. After surgery, some children may have issues with constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence (lack of control over bowel movements or urination). A handful may get enterocolitis. Signs include rectal bleeding, fever, vomiting, and a swollen abdomen. If that happens, take your child to the hospital at once. But with proper care -- especially a proper diet and plenty of water -- these conditions should subside and most children are able to experience normal bowel movements within a year of treatment. Other children will have bowel issues on and off into adulthood throughout their lives. Because Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital, it means it is a lifelong issue that should be monitored.It’s a cycle that’s vital to life -- we eat food, digest it, and excrete what we can’t use. Excretion, though often a subject of disgust or humor, is very important. It usually begins on the first day of a baby’s life, when the newborn passes their first stool, called the meconium. But some babies have trouble. If a baby can’t have a bowel movement, they may have Hirschsprung’s disease, a condition in which there are missing nerve cells in the large intestine. Hirschsprung’s disease is congenital -- that is, it develops during pregnancy and is present at birth. Some congenital conditions happen because of the mother’s diet, or because of an illness they had during their pregnancy. Others are because of genes the parents pass on to the newborn. Researchers don’t know why some people have Hirschsprung’s disease, though they believe the disease is related to flaws in DNA instructions. Though the disease can be deadly, modern medicine is able to fix the problem with surgery, and help children who have been treated to live relatively normal, healthy lives."

That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: ","Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy. That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam, your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: ","As with some types of cancer, doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy. Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and haematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters.

HLHS,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/hypoplastic-left-heart,"Signs of HLHS may not show up until a few days after birth. For the first day or two, a baby's heart can adjust to the defect. If the left side of the heart can't pump blood very well to the rest of the body, the right side will do more work. But the adjustment only lasts a few days. A newborn has a blood vessel that connects the two sides of their heart. It's called the patent ductus arteriosus, and it stays open for only a few days after birth. After that, it naturally closes. This is when most babies with the defect start to show symptoms from the lack of oxygen-rich blood and overworked heart.","Heart defects can show up on an ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy. So some parents find out about it before their babies are born. In other cases, HLHS is found a few days after the baby's born. The signs include: When your doctor listens to your baby's heartbeat, they may hear a heart murmur, which sounds like a whooshing noise. This happens because of the unusual blood flow HLHS causes. If your doctor thinks your baby might have HLHS, they'll order an echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make images of their heart on a video screen. It can show the chambers of the heart and track blood flow.","Doctors don't know why HLHS happens, but it does run in families. Some experts think that what the mother eats, drinks, or comes into contact with during pregnancy may also increase the risk that their baby will have HLHS. This might include smoking or drinking alcohol or not taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid.","Heart defects can show up on an ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy.

The first, called the Norwood procedure, is done soon after birth. It's a complicated surgery that makes a new aorta for your baby and lets the right ventricle of the heart pump all the blood to the body (after the ductus closes)."

Hole in the Heart,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ventricular-septal-defect,"Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart. This abnormality usually develops before birth and is found most often in infants. Normally, deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the upper chamber of the right side of the heart called the right atrium.  It passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen. After leaving the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, to the left atrium.  It then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to provide oxygen to all the tissues of the body.The ventricular septal defect may not be heard with a stethoscope until several days after birth. This is because a newborn's circulatory system changes during the first week, with a drop in the lung or pulmonary pressure creating the greater pressure differential between the 2 ventricles, which may increase the left-to-right shunt and produce an audible murmur. Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defects in infants","Small holes in the ventricular septum usually produce no symptoms but are often recognized by the child's health care provider when a loud heart murmur along the left side of the lower breast bone or sternum is heard. Large holes typically produce symptoms 1-6 months after an infant’s birth. The left ventricle begins to fail, producing the following symptoms: When a ventricular septal defect is not detected early in life, it can cause more severe problems and more severe symptoms as time goes on. The biggest concern is development of high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). If the ventricular septal defect is not surgically closed, irreversible pulmonary hypertension can develop, and the child may no longer benefit from surgery. The following are typical symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: The skin turns faintly bluish when the tissues are not receiving quite enough oxygen. This condition is often termed ""hypoxemia"" or ""hypoxia.""","No one knows what causes ventricular septal defects, but they probably come from a malformation of the heart that occurs while the infant is developing in the womb. The most common type of ventricular septal defect is the membranous variant. In this type, the hole is located below the aortic valve, which controls flow of blood from the left ventricle into the main artery of the body, the aorta.","If a ventricular septal defect is noted before your baby leaves the hospital, several tests may be ordered before discharge.A ventricular septal defect is detected on physical examination by a systolic murmur audible with a stethoscope along the lower left sternal or breast bone border. It is related to the oxygenated blood “swishing” through the hole or VSD into the right ventricle. The presence of a hole in the heart can be confirmed by echocardiogram. This painless test uses ultrasound waves to construct a moving picture of the heart. It can quantitate the size of the left-to-right shunt by enlargement of the left ventricle, pressure in the lungs, and actually estimate the degree of shunting by an empirical formula. Chest X-ray is useful to see if the overall heart size is enlarged, and may demonstrate evidence of fluid in the lungs or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram is helpful to evaluate the sizes of the left and right ventricle.  If right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated, this may suggest pulmonary hypertension.   Cardiac catheterization may be performed in certain circumstances.","If a larger ventricular septal defect is causing symptoms, your child's health care provider may prescribe medication."
Home Blood Sugar Monitoring,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/how-test-blood-glucose,"Most people with diabetes should test their blood sugar (aka blood glucose) levels regularly. Knowing the results lets you adjust your strategy for keeping the disease in check. Regular testing can also help you avoid getting long-term health problems that can stem from the condition, like: Research shows that in people with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, sticking to your target blood sugar and HbA1c levels makes complications less likely. There are several ways to test your blood sugar: From your fingertip: You prick your finger with a small, sharp needle (called a lancet) and put a drop of blood on a test strip. Then you put the test strip into a meter that shows your blood sugar level. You get results in less than 15 seconds and can store this information for  future use. Some meters can tell you your average blood sugar level over a period of time and show you charts and graphs of your past test results. You can get blood sugar meters and strips at your local pharmacy.Meters that test other sites: Newer meters let you test sites other than your fingertip, such as your upper arm, forearm, base of the thumb, and thigh. You may get different results than from your fingertip. Blood sugar levels in the fingertips show changes more quickly than those in other testing sites. This is especially true when your blood sugar is rapidly changing, like after a meal or after exercise. If you are checking your sugar when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia, you should use your fingertip if possible, because these readings will be more accurate. Continuous glucose monitoring system: These devices, also called interstitial glucose measuring devices, are combined with insulin pumps. They are similar to finger-stick glucose results and can show patterns and trends in your results over time.",,,"Keep good records of any blood, urine, or ketone tests you do. Most glucose monitors also have a memory. Your records can alert you to any problems or trends. These test records help your doctor make any needed changes in your meal plan, medicine, or exercise program. Bring these records with you every time you see your doctor.",
Home Blood Sugar Monitoring in Children,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/child-blood-sugar-problems,"If your youngster just had an ice cream sundae, you could probably guess that their blood sugar is high. You might be right. But if they're healthy, their levels will quickly get back to normal. So that kind of spike isn't really a problem. If their blood sugar levels stay up no matter what they have to eat, that's cause for concern. It could signal diabetes. Tip-offs that your child's blood sugar level may be too high include: Constant trips to the bathroom: If it seems like they have to pee all the time, it might be because their body is trying to flush out extra glucose. Extreme thirst: If your youngster is peeing a lot, they're losing a lot of fluids. They may try to get them back by drinking more than usual.Weight loss despite a big appetite: If your child is having trouble using glucose the right way, their body may start breaking down muscle and fat for energy. Feeling tired, moody, or irritable: A tyke that's too tired to play could literally be lacking energy, since their body isn't getting the fuel it needs. Vision problems: High blood sugar can pull fluid from the eye, making it hard to focus. Yeast infections: Yeast thrives on sugar, which may lead to infections in girls and diaper rashes in babies.","You might assume that lower blood sugar is better than high. That's true, but only up to a certain point: If blood sugar goes too low, it means your child won't have enough fuel. If it gets really low (your doctor may call it hypoglycemia), your child could have a seizure or even develop brain damage. A child who doesn't have diabetes might have an episode of hypoglycemia because they skipped lunch before soccer practice. It's also possible that a medicine your child takes raises their chances of having low blood sugar. They also could have been born with a condition that affects their metabolism. In any case, unless the cause is clear-cut (like not eating before being active), you should have your child's pediatrician investigate.If your child has low blood sugar, you may notice: Your child might tell you that they: The skin around their mouth might also tingle, and it might feel like their heart is racing. Severe hypoglycemia can make your child pass out. If that, or a seizure, happens, call for medical help right away.Most of us don't check our kid's blood sugar.

Home Health Supplies,https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/home-health-care-tips,"What is mobility? Mobility is how well you can walk and move, whether that’s getting to the bathroom or kitchen on your own, or doing fun things like going out to lunch with friends and traveling. Many people lose mobility as they age or because of health conditions or surgery. When you can’t walk easily or comfortably you may stay home more, which can leave you feeling lonely and cut off from people and things you enjoy. Being mobile isn’t just important for your independence. It can also help you avoid some health problems, including depression, incontinence, heart disease, and osteoporosis. Plus, regular walking and movement can help prevent falls by keeping your muscles strong and maintaining your balance.How can I improve my mobility? The best thing you can do is get physically active. Do a combination of aerobic exercise to get your heart pumping (like walking or swimming), resistance exercises to build and maintain your muscles (like lifting weights), and stretching to improve your flexibility. You’re never too old to start exercising. No matter what your age, when you start an exercise program, you’ll benefit. There are many ways to get your heart pumping even if you have trouble walking or are not able to move your body well. You can exercise while sitting in a chair or in a pool using flotation devices. Talk to your doctor for specific exercises. You can also ask your doctor for a referral to a physical or occupational therapist. A physical therapist will teach you exercises that will help you get moving. An occupational therapist can teach you new ways to do everyday tasks, which can increase your mobility.",,,,

Homozygous Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency-rare,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it’s passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight.You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you’ll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through.","You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get it between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also could start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe.You may also get a lot of lung infections. Other warning signs include: If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you could have symptoms like: A newborn baby might have: It’s rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency runs in families. If you have it, you got it from faulty genes that both your parents passed down to you. Some people get the genes but don't have any symptoms. Or they have a mild version of the disease. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. That buildup in your liver causes liver disease. The shortage of AAT protein in your bloodstream leads to lung disease.","Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. You need to get blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also tests your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage.","Although there’s no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. Doctors call this augmentation therapy. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. Augmentation therapy is also called replacement therapy. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You get the treatment once a week. The replacement alpha-1 gets into your body through an IV. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. The goal of augmentation therapy is to slow or stop the damage in your lungs. It won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You’ll need these treatments for the rest of your life. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. Doctors call this a bronchodilator, meaning that it opens your airways. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor will also give you a referral for pulmonary rehab to help you breathe better."
Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia,https://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-management/homozygous-familial-hypercholesterolemia,"Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a disorder where it is hard for your body to remove LDL ""bad"" cholesterol from your blood. The disease raises your chances of a heart attack at an early age, but drugs and other treatments can lower your risk. Cholesterol is waxy stuff that's in your cells. LDL's job is to carry cholesterol around your body in your bloodstream. When you have high levels of LDL, cholesterol builds up in your arteries, the blood vessels that supply oxygen to your heart. The cholesterol can eventually block them and shut off the flow of blood and oxygen to your heart, causing a heart attack. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is a disease you're born with. You can start developing high cholesterol when you're a child. It's a serious condition. Without treatment, men with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia can get heart disease in their 40s, and women can get it in their 50s. There's no cure, so you'll need to take drugs and follow a heart-healthy diet throughout your life. If that's not enough, there are special treatments including one that takes blood from your body, removes the cholesterol, and then returns the blood back to you. For some people, this treatment still won't keep cholesterol under control. If that's the case for you, you may need to have a liver transplant. It's major surgery with a lot of recovery time, so it's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need.","The main sign that you have this condition is very high levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. For instance, you may have a total cholesterol level of 600 points or higher. By comparison, the American Heart Association recommends the ideal total cholesterol number be less than 200. You may have yellow, waxy patches on your skin over the elbows, knees, and buttocks. These are called xanthomas. Yellowish fat deposits called xanthelasmas can develop in your eyelids. Also, you can get gray or white circles around your cornea, the clear front part of the eye. Some symptoms of heart disease you may have include:","When you have homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, you inherit two copies of a gene that isn't working right, one from each of your parents. Normally, the liver removes extra LDL cholesterol from the blood using particles called LDL receptors. These receptors attach to LDL cholesterol and play a key role in keeping your cholesterol levels under control. When you have this disease, the faulty gene keeps the LDL receptors from working right. Your cholesterol levels get high. You may hear the term heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. This is a related disease. With it, you inherit the broken gene from only one of your parents. It's not as severe as the homozygous form.","Your doctor will do a physical exam and also take some blood tests. To help make a diagnosis, they may ask you:Your doctor will check your cholesterol levels by taking a blood sample and sending it to a lab to be analyzed. You may have a blood test to look for the abnormal gene that causes this condition. Your doctor might also want to test some of your close relatives to see if they have the disease.","The goal is to lower your LDL cholesterol levels, and your risk for heart disease. You will likely be referred to a doctor that specializes in treating people with cholesterol or lipid disorders. Your doctor will probably recommend that you stick to a diet that's low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and sugar. They may need to try different combinations of drugs and treatments until they find one that works best for you.Since homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia raises your cholesterol to extremely high levels, your doctor may start you on high doses of statin drugs. Statins work by stopping your liver from making cholesterol. Your doctor may also try combining statins with other drugs that lower the amount of cholesterol that gets into your body from the food you eat. Options include ezetimibe (Zetia), a PCSK9 inhibitor like alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha), or lomitapide (Juxtapid). If different combinations of medicine aren't doing the job, your doctor may also add injections of inclisiran (Leqvio) which has been approved as an add-on therapy to further lower (LDL-C). They may also ask you to try a treatment called apheresis. It removes cholesterol from your blood. It's a little bit like dialysis, the treatment that's used for kidney disease. You go to a clinic or hospital where some of your blood is removed through a tube called a catheter. LDL cholesterol is taken out of your blood before it's returned to your body. The procedure takes several hours, and you'll need to do it regularly."

See your doctor if you notice any of its symptoms.Symptoms of Horner syndrome in children Children who get Horner syndrome before age 2 also can have:  ","In about 35% to 40% of cases, doctors aren’t sure what exactly causes Horner syndrome. Some researchers think it can be tied to your genes. Other times, it happens because of damage to a string of nerves (called a pathway) that helps control your eyes, heart rate, sweat, and blood pressure. One of three pathways may be involved in Horner syndrome: First order (central) This pathway involves the nerves that run from the hypothalamus in your brain to your chest, through your brain stem and spinal cord. Conditions that can affect it include:Second order (preganglionic) These nerves go from your chest to the top of your lungs and along the carotid artery in your neck. They might be affected by: Third order (postganglionic) This path runs from your neck to your middle ear and eye. Things that can affect it include: Neck or shoulder injuries during birth can cause Horner syndrome in some babies, but it's very rare. Babies born with damage to their aorta can also have it. And neuroblastoma, a type of cancer, can cause it in some kids. Only 5% of people who have Horner syndrome are born with it.","Your doctor or an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) can do tests to check for Horner syndrome. They’ll do a physical exam and ask about your medical history to find out if you've had any illness or injury that could have caused nerve damage. Then, they’ll put drops in your eyes to see how your pupils react.Other tests may show a growth, damage, or injury that could cause Horner syndrome. The doctor might order one or more of these: Your doctor also may want to test your blood or urine to check for any health problems that could cause nerve damage.","There aren’t any treatments specifically for Horner syndrome. The best way to ease your symptoms is to treat the health problem that caused them. If you have a tumor or lesion, your doctor might remove it through surgery. You could also have radiation and chemotherapy."
Hospice,https://www.webmd.com/palliative-care/journeys-end-active-dying,"When your loved one's health care team recognizes that they are likely within 6 months of dying, they may recommend switching to hospice, a more specialized care for people with a terminal illness who are expected to die. Your loved one will still get treatment for pain relief and comfort, but hospice also offers emotional and spiritual support for them as well as you and close family.","There are changes you can expect to see as an adult body stops working. These are a normal part of dying. Children and teens have a similar process, but it can be harder to predict. They often stay fairly active and continue to ask a lot of tough-to-answer questions.1 to 3 months before death, your loved one is likely to: 1 to 2 weeks before death, the person may feel tired and drained all the time, so much that they don't leave their bed. They could have: Breathing trouble can be distressing for family members, but often it isn't painful and can be managed. Pain can be treated, too. But your loved one may have a hard time taking medicine by mouth. Hallucinations and visions, especially of long-gone loved ones, can be comforting. If seeing and talking to someone who isn't there makes the person who's dying happier, you don't need to try to convince them that they aren't real. It may upset them and make them argue and fight with you.",,,
Hospice Care,https://www.webmd.com/palliative-care/hospice-care,"You may enter a program if your doctor states that you have a terminal illness and that death can be expected in 6 months or less. You can stay in hospice beyond that time if your doctor and the team decide you still have only a short time to live. Hospice isn't always a permanent choice. For example, if your kidneys are failing, you might choose the hospice program rather than continuing with dialysis. But you can still change your mind, stop hospice care, and start back on treatments. Other people may get better unexpectedly and quit the service with the option of returning later. Hospice differs from palliative care, which serves anyone who is seriously ill, not just those who are dying and no longer seeking a cure.",,,,

During an asthma attack, the smooth muscles that surround the airways tighten and cause the airways to narrow. The peak flow meter alerts you to the tightening of the airways often hours or even days before you have any asthma symptoms. By using your PEF with your asthma action plan, you will know when to take your rescue (quick acting) asthma inhaler or other asthma medicine. By following the steps in your asthma action plan, you may be able to stop the narrowing of the airways quickly and avoid a severe asthma emergency.The peak flow meter can also be used to help you: It is important to know that your peak flow meter only measures the amount of airflow out of the large airways of the lungs. Changes in airflow caused by the small airways (which also occur with asthma) will not be detected by a peak flow meter. Early warning signs, however, may be present.

How to Stop Bleeding From a Minor Head Wound,https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/guide/head-injuries-causes-and-treatments,"There are many different types of head injuries.  Concussion. This is the most common type of head injury. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that happens when the brain is jarred or shaken hard enough to bounce against the skull. It can range from mild to severe. You don't have to be hit in the head to get a concussion. An impact elsewhere on the body can create enough force to jar the brain.  Contusion. A bruise on the actual brain itself is called a contusion. It can cause bleeding and swelling.  Intracranial hematoma (ICH). This is bleeding under the skull in the brain that forms a clot. Brain hematomas range from mild to severe and are grouped according to where they form. Skull fracture. Sometimes, a broken skull bone can affect the brain. The broken pieces of bone can cut into the brain and cause bleeding and other types of injury.","Signs and symptoms of a concussion may show up immediately, or they can take hours or even days to show up. You don’t always lose consciousness with a concussion. A concussion causes changes in a person's mental status and can disrupt the normal functioning of the brain. Multiple concussions can have a long-lasting, life-changing effect. Signs of a TBI, like a concussion, include: Confusion Depression Dizziness or balance problems Double or fuzzy vision Feeling foggy or groggy Feeling sluggish or tired Headache Memory loss Nausea Sensitivity to light or noise Sleep disturbance Trouble concentrating Trouble remembering Signs or symptoms that a head injury may be more than a concussion and requires emergency treatment include: Changes in size of pupils Clear or bloody fluid draining from the nose, mouth, or ears Convulsions Distorted facial features Facial bruising Fracture in the skull or face Impaired hearing, smell, taste, or vision Inability to move one or more limbs Irritability Lightheadedness Loss of consciousness Low breathing rate Restlessness, clumsiness, or lack of coordination Severe headache Slurred speech or blurred vision Stiff neck or vomiting Sudden worsening of symptoms after initial improvement Swelling at the site of the injury Persistent vomiting","The most important step to take is to buy and properly use protective head gear that has been approved by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Be sure to buy the right size for a proper fit and to wear the helmet or headgear properly. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, helmets or headgear should be worn at all times for the following activities: Baseball and softball Cycling Football Hockey Horseback riding Riding powered recreational vehicles Skateboarding and riding scooters Skiing Snowboarding WrestlingIn addition, the FDA has approved the noninvasive device, called Q-Collar which can be worn by athletes to help prevent head injuries. The C-shaped collar applies compressive force to the neck and increases blood volume to help reduce movement of the brain, which may occur because of hits to the head. The device may reduce specific changes in the brain that are associated with brain injury. Other things you can do to keep yourself and your kids safer: Wear light-reflecting clothes when riding a bike at night. Don't dive in water less than 12 feet deep or any body of water where you cannot see the bottom, murky water. Make sure that children's play areas and equipment are safe and in good repair. Don't let children play sports that are inappropriate for their age. Supervise and teach children how to properly use sports equipment. Don't wear clothing that interferes with vision. Follow all rules at water parks and swimming pools. Don't skateboard or cycle on uneven or unpaved surfaces. Don't play sports when you are tired or very ill.Head injuries are damage to the scalp, skull, or brain caused by trauma. When it affects the brain, they’re called  a traumatic brain injury, or TBI.  To most people, head injuries are considered an acceptable risk when engaging in sports and other types of recreational activities. But they’re dangerous. They can lead to permanent disability, mental impairment, and even death. There are steps you can take to lower the risk and protect yourself and your children.  ",,"If you think you may have a concussion or suspect that someone else has one, the most important step to take is to prevent further injury. Stop whatever activity you are involved in and tell someone you think you may have been injured. Then get medical attention. If you're playing as part of a team, ask to be taken out of the game and tell the coach what happened. If a fellow player has signs of being confused or a sudden loss of coordination, be sure to report this to a coach. If you are coaching a team and you notice a potential injury, take the person out of the game, and see that the person gets medical care. Receiving medical attention as soon as possible is important for any type of potentially moderate to severe TBI. Undiagnosed injuries that don't receive proper care can cause long-term disability and impairment. Keep in mind that although death from a sports injury is rare, brain injuries are the leading cause of sports-related deaths.Symptoms should be closely monitored often with a moderate to severe injury. It may require an overnight stay in the hospital. A doctor may take X-rays to check for potential skull fracture and stability of the spine. In some cases the doctor may ask for a CT scan or an MRI to check on the extent of the damage that occurred. More severe injuries may need surgery to relieve pressure from swelling.  If a child sustains a head injury, don’t automatically have them X-rayed. Monitor them carefully for age appropriate symptoms of a TBI such as confusion or behavioral change. Don’t give them medications, including aspirin, without advice from your doctors. If the doctor sends you home with an injured person, they may instruct you to watch that person closely. That may involve waking the person every few hours to ask questions such as ""What's your name?"" or ""Where are you?"" to be sure the person is OK. Be sure you've asked the doctor and understand what symptoms to watch for and which ones require immediate attention. Guidelines urge doctors not allow someone who has been injured to return to activity that involves risk of further injury until completely free of symptoms. Most teens recover within two weeks, while it may take younger children up to four weeks to recover. But symptoms of severe injury could persist for months or even years. A person with a moderate to serious injury will likely require rehabilitation that may include physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, medication, psychological counseling, and social support."

How to Stop Thumb-Sucking,https://www.webmd.com/baby/features/breaking-thumb-sucking-habit,"Most experts agree that a thumb-sucker younger than 5 shouldn't be pressured to stop. Most children will give up the habit on their own before they enter kindergarten. ""Thumb-sucking is an appropriate and useful behavior for very young children,"" says Linda Goldstein, MD, a Washington pediatrician. ""It allows them to comfort and entertain themselves."" In fact, more than three-quarters of infants suck their thumbs or fingers through the first year of life. A child usually turns to the thumb when bored, tired, or upset. It is not uncommon to see a thumb-sucker simultaneously engage in other behaviors, such as twirling a strand of hair, holding onto an ear, or rubbing a blankie. ""Even when the habit lingers past infancy, thumb-sucking is rarely something to be concerned about. It doesn't indicate that a child has emotional problems or that he will still be sucking his finger when he's a teenager,"" says Sabine Hack, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine.",,,,"Breaking a habit is a much easier feat when the child is a willing participant. Many parents have success with a simple behavioral approach that engages the child in the process. Here's how it works:First, says Hack, call a one-month moratorium on discussion. ""If finger-sucking is part of a power struggle, not mentioning it may help extinguish the behavior,"" she says. Next, buy poster board and stickers and make a ""progress chart."" Offer a prize at the end of each week for no sucking -- and a larger reward at the end of the month. Make sure that your child has an active role in the plan; for example, decide together how many slip-ups he's allowed each week and have him choose the stickers and place them on the chart. It may also be helpful to place a bitter-tasting liquid on the nail (not directly on the finger), especially at night, as a reminder not to suck. Products for this purpose are sold over the counter, but home remedies can be just as effective. What worked for Michael was perfume. Each night for two weeks, I asked him to choose a bottle of perfume from my collection. He would sniff them all, pick one, and I would place a dab at the tip of his finger. ""Yuck,"" he'd always say, but he clearly welcomed the crutch. Mittens, gloves, or a finger-splint may also be worn at night. It may take six weeks or more to successfully break the habit."
How to Use a Condom,https://teens.webmd.com/boys/how-to-use-a-condom,"A condom is a thin, fitted tube worn over the penis during sex (male condoms) or inserted into the vagina before sex (female condoms).

Hunter Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/children/hunter-syndrome-mps-ii,"Hunter syndrome, also called mucopolysaccharidosis II or MPS II, is a rare disease that's passed on in families. It mainly affects boys. Their bodies can't break down a kind of sugar that builds bones, skin, tendons, and other tissue. Those sugars build up in their cells and damage many parts of the body, including the brain. Exactly what happens is different for every person. When your son has Hunter syndrome, there are things you can do to help them play, have friends, and do some of the things that other kids do, even though they may look different from their pals. Although there is no cure for Hunter syndrome, there are ways to help manage it and live with the symptoms.","When Hunter syndrome affects the brain, which is about 75% of the time, symptoms usually show up between 18 months and 4 years of age. They start about 2 years later when the disease is milder. Hunter syndrome usually affects how the boy looks: They'll probably have these symptoms: When a boy's brain is affected, it's likely they'll have: Kids who have Hunter syndrome are usually cheerful and affectionate, despite the problems it can cause.","Boys with the disease can't make a certain protein because there's a problem with a small piece of their DNA, called a gene, that comes from their mother. A dad with Hunter syndrome will pass the problem gene to their daughter, but the daughter won't get the disease unless they get the gene from their mom, too. It's possible -- but very, very unlikely -- that someone could develop Hunter syndrome even though no one in their family going back has had it.","Doctors often have to rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor may ask: If the doctors can't find another explanation for your son's symptoms, they'll test for Hunter syndrome by checking for: After doctors are sure it's Hunter syndrome, it's a good idea to let extended family members know about the gene problem, too.

Huntington's Chorea (HD),https://www.webmd.com/brain/hungtingtons-disease-causes-symptoms-treatment,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary and deadly disorder that causes nerve cells in the brain to break down. This causes physical and mental abilities to weaken, and they get worse over time. There is no cure. If it starts early in life, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s disease. A diagnosis of Huntington's disease may come as quite a shock. There's a lot to take in. But tapping into a support system, such as a social worker, therapist, or support group, can make the journey a bit less daunting. With the help of a healthcare team, people with Huntington's can live independently for many years.","  Although symptoms may first show up in midlife, Huntington's can strike anyone from childhood to advanced age. Symptoms often first appear when people are in their 30s or 40s. Over 10 to 25 years, the disease gradually kills nerve cells in the brain. This affects the body, mind, and emotions. If symptoms begin before age 20, it’s called juvenile Huntington’s Disease and it may get worse faster.Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person. And stress or excitement can worsen symptoms. Some symptoms are easier to spot than others. Abnormal movements may be the first thing you notice. Weight loss can be a concern at all stages. Symptoms of Huntington's disease tend to develop in stages. Early stage symptoms Changes may be quite subtle in early stages, making it possible to keep driving and working. You may just require a little extra help. Common early symptoms include: Trouble learning new things Trouble making decisions Memory lapses Mood swings Clumsiness Slow or abnormal eye movements Muscle problems (dystonia) Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Loss of energy and fatigue   Middle stage symptoms With time, symptoms begin to interfere more with your day-to-day life. For example, you might start to drop things or to fall. Or you may have trouble speaking or swallowing. Staying organized may be difficult. And emotional changes may put pressure on relationships. Common middle stage symptoms include: Uncontrolled twitching movements (chorea) Trouble walking Confusion Memory loss Personality changes Speech changes Decline in thinking abilities Swallowing problems Breathing problems Thoughts of death, dying, or suicide Weight loss Development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, or mania ","In 1993, researchers found the gene that causes Huntington's. Everyone has the HD gene, but in some families an abnormal copy of the gene gets passed from parent to child. If you have a parent with Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of having the gene and developing the disease. Also: Men and women are equally likely to inherit the abnormal gene. If you don't have the abnormal gene, you can't get Huntington's or pass it on to your children. The disease doesn't skip generations. If you or members of your family plan to be tested for Huntington's, it's a good idea to get professional genetic counseling first. Counselors can help explain what to expect from the test results. With knowledge about the HD gene, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about how the disease affects the brain. More importantly, this discovery may help pave the way for future treatment.",,"  For now, treating Huntington's involves managing symptoms: Medications can help control fidgety movements. Your doctor can work closely with you to manage any side effects and to change medications, if needed. Some antipsychotic drugs have a side effect that controls movement and have been helpful for some people. Antidepressants can also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders, but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.  Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family. Family members can help by making some changes at home: Serve extra meals and add high-calorie supplements to help you stay at a healthy weight. Limit distractions during meal times.  Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and at stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication."

Common middle stage symptoms include: Uncontrolled twitching movements (chorea) Trouble walking Confusion Memory loss Personality changes Speech changes Decline in thinking abilities Swallowing problems Breathing problems Thoughts of death, dying, or suicide Weight loss Development of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder, or mania ","In 1993, researchers found the gene that causes Huntington's. Everyone has the HD gene, but in some families an abnormal copy of the gene gets passed from parent to child. If you have a parent with Huntington's disease, you have a 50% chance of having the gene and developing the disease. Also: Men and women are equally likely to inherit the abnormal gene. If you don't have the abnormal gene, you can't get Huntington's or pass it on to your children. The disease doesn't skip generations. If you or members of your family plan to be tested for Huntington's, it's a good idea to get professional genetic counseling first. Counselors can help explain what to expect from the test results. With knowledge about the HD gene, scientists have been able to learn a great deal about how the disease affects the brain. More importantly, this discovery may help pave the way for future treatment.",,"  For now, treating Huntington's involves managing symptoms: Medications can help control fidgety movements. Your doctor can work closely with you to manage any side effects and to change medications, if needed. Some antipsychotic drugs have a side effect that controls movement and have been helpful for some people. Antidepressants can also help with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Mood-stabilizing drugs can ease symptoms of mood disorders, but may cause other side effects. Speech or language therapy may be helpful for any problems with speech or swallowing. Occupational or physical therapy may help you learn how to better control movements. And assistive devices such as handrails can help you manage your changing physical abilities. Nutritional support ranges from using special utensils to focusing on nutrient-dense foods to supplementing with tube feeding in later stages. Exercise may be very helpful. People with Huntington's who stay as fit and active as they can seem to do better than those who do not. Psychotherapy can teach you ways to manage changes in your emotions and how you think.  Strategies like breaking tasks into simpler steps may go a long way toward making these changes a bit easier for you and your family. Family members can help by making some changes at home: Serve extra meals and add high-calorie supplements to help you stay at a healthy weight. Limit distractions during meal times.  Choose foods that are easier to chew and swallow. Use forks and other utensils made for people with limited motor skills. Use covered cups with straws or drinking spouts. Keep a regular routine. Use phone or computer reminders for tasks. Keep life as calm, simple, and low-stress as possible. For children, work with the school counselor to make an education plan. See friends and maintain social interactions as much as possible. Add wheelchair ramps and elevators to the home if possible. Add safety bars in bathrooms, next to the bed, and at stairs. Use voice-controlled lights and other “smart” home features. Use electronic speech programs or picture charts to aid communication."
Hurler Disease,https://www.webmd.com/children/mucopolysaccharidosis-i-mps-i,"MPS I stands for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. It starts in childhood. You can't ""catch"" it -- it comes from your genes. People with MPS I can't make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease.  Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms:","Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar:MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways:","MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene. If you get one normal gene and one ""bad"" gene, you won't have symptoms of MPS I. You could pass the gene to your children, though.","Because it's a rare disease, doctors rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor might ask: If the doctors can't find another explanation for your child's symptoms, they'll test for MPS I by checking for:After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you are pregnant, know you are a carrier of the gene, and already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing. ","Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) uses a drug called laronidase (Aldurazyme), a man-made version of the missing protein. It has changed the outlook for many kids with MPS I. It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning.Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. These cells often come from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better. But HSCT can't fix bone or eye problems. Work with a doctor who specializes in lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Depending on what symptoms your child has, you might need to see other specialists, too. Often they'll include a cardiologist, who focuses on the heart, and an eye doctor."

Children with progeria usually die of heart attacks or strokes. Progeria doesn't affect a child's intelligence or brain development. A child with the condition isn't any more likely to get infections than other kids, either.","A mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene causes progeria. The gene makes a protein that holds together the center of a cell. With progeria, the body makes an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which leads to rapid aging.

Hydatidiform Mole,https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-is-molar-pregnancy,"It’s due to problems with the fertilized egg. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes -- one set from the mother and the other from the father. These structures carry information that tells the body’s cells what to do. In a molar pregnancy, there’s an extra set of chromosomes that comes from the father. When this happens, a fertilized egg can’t survive. It usually dies a few weeks into the pregnancy.","At first, your pregnancy might seem normal. But over time, you may start to notice the following: Call your doctor if you have these or any other unusual symptoms during pregnancy.","In the United States, molar pregnancy occurs in about 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies. Certain things may increase the chances it will happen:",,"Your doctor may use a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C). This is often the treatment for pregnancy loss due to any reason. During this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix with special tools and removes the tissue from your uterus. This is the best option for you if you want to get pregnant again. After a D&C, your doctor may do blood tests several times over the next few months. They will look to see whether your HCG levels are getting back to normal. If you don’t want to get pregnant again, then you may consider a total hysterectomy. That’s surgery to remove your uterus.In rare cases, a complete molar pregnancy can lead to a condition called persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). This means the abnormal tissue grows outside your uterus and into the layer of muscle below it. A D&C won’t work because it only removes tissue within the uterus. You may need to have a hysterectomy or receive chemotherapy (“chemo”) to treat persistent GTD. A molar pregnancy can also lead to a cancerous form of GTD called choriocarcinoma. You’ll need to have chemo to treat it. After a molar pregnancy, your doctor might recommend that you don’t conceive for 1 year. Pregnancy increases HCG levels, so it would be hard for them to know whether the rise in hormones is due to that, abnormal tissue that’s still in your body, or choriocarcinoma.A positive pregnancy test is often followed by the joy of a newborn baby 9 months later. But there are times when a pregnancy ends in a loss. A molar pregnancy is one of those. During a healthy pregnancy, the placenta grows inside your uterus. It nourishes your baby through the umbilical cord. With a molar pregnancy, tissue in the uterus becomes an abnormal mass or tumor instead of a placenta. There are two types of molar pregnancy -- partial and complete. A partial one is when both the placenta and embryo (fertilized egg) are abnormal. In a complete molar pregnancy, there’s an abnormal placenta, but no embryo."
Hydrocele,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/hydrocele-baby-boys,"A hydrocele is a swelling in the scrotum, the thin sac that holds the testicles. It happens when too much fluid builds up inside. The condition is most common in newborns, though it can happen to anyone with a scrotum. It may sound or look serious, even painful, but it won’t hurt your baby. It might go away on its own, though you should still see the doctor about it.","A hydrocele doesn’t hurt. The only symptom you’ll notice is that one or both of the baby’s testicles look swollen. Even if they are not in pain, you should see the pediatrician to make sure they don’t have other health problems that are causing the swelling, such as an infection, a tumor, or a hernia. The swelling from a noncommunicating hydrocele doesn’t have changes in size. A communicating hydrocele can get bigger during the day, and if you gently squeeze it, the fluid will move out of the scrotum and into their belly.","A hydrocele can start before your baby is born. The testicles grow inside their belly and then move down into their scrotum through a short tunnel. A sac of fluid goes with each testicle. Usually, the tunnel and the sac seal off before birth, and the baby’s body absorbs the fluid inside. When this process doesn’t go as it should, they can get a hydrocele. There are two types of hydrocele:  Babies born prematurely are more likely to have a hydrocele.","When you take your baby to the doctor, they’ll do a physical exam. They’ll check the scrotum for fluid and tenderness, and shine a light through it to see if there’s fluid around their testicle. Your doctor will also check to make sure your baby doesn’t have a hernia. Your baby may also have a blood test and an ultrasound to make sure nothing else is causing the swelling.","A hydrocele usually goes away on its own before a boy’s first birthday. If it doesn’t, or if it gets bigger, their doctor will refer them to a specialist called a urologist.  If your son has a communicating hydrocele, the pediatrician will usually recommend surgery without waiting for it to go away. The doctor can remove a hydrocele in a brief operation called a hydrocelectomy. Your baby will get a local numbing agent or be put to sleep under anesthesia.Then, a surgeon makes a cut in their scrotum or lower belly. The surgeon then drains the fluid and sews the sac closed. Once it’s finished, your son can go home the same day. In the days after surgery, you’ll need to keep the area clean and dry. The doctor and team will show you how to care for your baby as they heal. After a few days, you may need to take them back to the doctor to make sure they are healing well."
Hydrocephalus,https://www.webmd.com/brain/hydrocephalus-facts,"Hydrocephalus -- which roughly means “water on the brain” -- is the buildup of fluid in the cavities (ventricles) deep within the brain. This fluid doesn’t flow or get absorbed the way it should. That can lead to backups and blockages that put pressure on your brain. You’ve probably heard that the human body is mostly water. That’s true. From your blood to the fluids that flow in and around your tissues and organs, liquid makes up about 70% of your body. Your head is no different. Your skull is filled with a fluid that surrounds your brain’s folds and lobes. It’s called cerebrospinal fluid, and it cushions your brain from injuries and has nutrients and proteins that help keep it healthy and working. Cerebrospinal fluid also: Allows the relatively heavy brain to float within the skull Removes waste products of the brain’s metabolism Flows back and forth between the brain cavity and spinal column to regulate pressure in the brain Hydrocephalus happens most often in infants or in adults older than 60, but you can have it at any age. It can’t be cured, but with early diagnosis and treatment, people can live active lives. ","Symptoms of hydrocephalus can be different depending on your age. In babies, they include: An unusually large head that gets bigger quickly The soft spot on top of a baby’s head is firm or bulging Eyes that are focused downward (sometimes called “sunsetting of the eyes”) Crankiness or irritability Vomiting or poor feeding Seizures Poor muscle tone and strength Less responsive to touch Poor growth Symptoms of hydrocephalus in toddlers and children: Headaches Eyes that are focused downward (sometimes called “sunsetting of the eyes”) Blurry vision An unusually large head Sleepiness or low energy Nausea or vomiting Bad balance or coordination Problems with gait (walking) Lack of appetite Seizures Peeing often or loss of bladder control Crankiness or change in mood Change in personality Trouble doing well in school Delays or problems in already acquired skills, such as walking and talking   Symptoms of hydrocephalus in adults younger than 60: Headaches Tiredness Poor balance or coordination Peeing often or loss of bladder control Changes in vision A drop-off in memory or concentration that causes problems at work Symptoms of hydrocephalus in adults older than 60: Peeing often or loss of bladder control Memory loss Trouble with planning or processing skills Problems walking or poor coordination Dementia General slowing of movements","The three main causes of hydrocephalus are: A blockage. Tumors, cysts, birth defects, brain injury, or stroke can block or affect the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid. Poor fluid absorption. Inflammation, injuries, or infections like bacterial meningitis can keep your brain tissues from taking in cerebrospinal fluid.","Your doctor will start with a physical examination and ask about your symptoms, then recommend tests to look for signs of hydrocephalus. Tests may include: Neurological exam to check muscle strength, reflexes, coordination, balance, vision, eye movement, hearing, mental functioning, and mood Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a scan that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make detailed images of your brain Computerized tomography (CT) scan, a series of X-rays taken from different angles that are put together to make a more complete picture of your brain Spinal tap, when a doctor inserts a needle into the lower back in order to remove and test some of the fluid Intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP), which uses a small monitor inserted into the brain to measure how much swelling is there; intracranial pressure can also be measured by EVD (external ventricular drain) or lumbar drain (like a lumbar puncture but a small catheter stays in place to measure pressure and to drain fluid). Fundoscopic exam, which looks at the nerve behind the eye to see if swelling is present","If your symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment. If they’re serious, your doctor probably will recommend surgery to put a flexible plastic tube called a shunt in your brain to redirect the cerebrospinal fluid into another part of your body, like your belly. The shunt typically isn’t ever removed, and regular checkups are important to make sure it’s working. In some cases, hydrocephalus can be treated without using a shunt. One type of surgery, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, opens a pathway in your brain so the fluid can flow freely, while the other closes off the part of your brain that makes cerebrospinal fluid. If your hydrocephalus is due to a tumor, the tumor can be removed; if it is due to a stroke, the skull may be opened to relieve pressure and swelling. Some medications help slow the production of CSF, such as acetazolamide (Diamox). Many people with hydrocephalus find help through therapy and education. Specialists may provide: Occupational therapy to help children and adults with life skills Developmental therapy to help children learn social behaviors Special education for learning disabilities Mental health care or social workers to provide emotional support and help families find services Dementia care"

Common reasons for congenital hydrocephalus include:","Routine ultrasound tests during pregnancy may be able to pick up problems with your baby’s brain development, such as enlarged ventricles or spaces within the brain. If a problem shows up on ultrasound, further tests can help diagnose the issue more clearly. Because some babies with hydrocephalus also have other serious health issues, your doctor will want to get a full picture of your baby’s overall condition. So you might get other tests, such as an MRI – which can provide more details on your baby’s brain development. Your doctor may also take a sample of your amniotic fluid, to check on your baby’s chromosomes. Your doctor will also want to know about your family’s health history, especially if any of your relatives have had any neural tube defects.","Even though doctors can diagnose hydrocephaly in the womb, treatment generally doesn’t begin until your baby is born. The most common treatment for congenital hydrocephaly is a shunt system. A surgeon will place a flexible plastic tube in the baby’s brain to drain the extra fluid. The other end of the tube goes under the skin and into the belly, or another place in the body where the excess CSF can be absorbed. Another possible treatment is called ETV (endoscopic third ventriculostomy), which uses fiber-optic technology. A doctor guides a small camera into a baby’s brain and, with a tool, opens a hole in a ventricle, bypassing a blockage. The brain fluid then drains through that hole and is absorbed into the bloodstream."

We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons.","UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days:Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years.

They include:",,"Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy. They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis.","UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel.

For the first day or two, a baby's heart can adjust to the defect. If the left side of the heart can't pump blood very well to the rest of the body, the right side will do more work. But the adjustment only lasts a few days. A newborn has a blood vessel that connects the two sides of their heart. It's called the patent ductus arteriosus, and it stays open for only a few days after birth. After that, it naturally closes. This is when most babies with the defect start to show symptoms from the lack of oxygen-rich blood and overworked heart.","Heart defects can show up on an ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy.

The signs include: When your doctor listens to your baby's heartbeat, they may hear a heart murmur, which sounds like a whooshing noise. This happens because of the unusual blood flow HLHS causes. If your doctor thinks your baby might have HLHS, they'll order an echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to make images of their heart on a video screen. It can show the chambers of the heart and track blood flow.","Doctors don't know why HLHS happens, but it does run in families. Some experts think that what the mother eats, drinks, or comes into contact with during pregnancy may also increase the risk that their baby will have HLHS. This might include smoking or drinking alcohol or not taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid.","Heart defects can show up on an ultrasound during the second trimester of pregnancy.

IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome),https://www.webmd.com/ibs/guide/digestive-diseases-irritable-bowel-syndrome,"IBS is a mix of belly discomfort or pain and trouble with bowel habits: either going more or less often than normal (diarrhea or constipation) or having a different kind of stool (thin, hard, or soft and liquid). Doctors used to call IBS other names including: There are four types of the condition: IBS isn’t life-threatening, and it doesn't make you more likely to get other colon conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer. But it can be a long-lasting problem that changes how you live your life. People with IBS may miss work or school more often, and they may feel less able to take part in daily activities. Some people may need to change their work setting: shifting to working at home, changing hours, or even not working at all.","People with IBS have symptoms that can include: Other things may cause these symptoms sometimes. If it’s IBS, you’ll likely have these symptoms weekly for 3 months, or less often for at least 6 months. Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their period. Some people also have urinary symptoms or sexual problems. Stress can make symptoms worse. When to call your doctor  If you have an IBS symptom that lasts a long time, you get a new symptom, or your pain is worse than usual or you have new pain, see your doctor. If you usually take over-the-counter medications but now they don’t ease problems like diarrhea, gas, or cramping, you also need to see a doctor.Even if you don’t think a problem is physically part of IBS, but it bothers you, tell your doctor. For example, if you’re stressed out or anxious about it, or if you’re losing sleep over the problem, let your doctor know. IBS usually doesn’t lead to more serious diseases, but there are “red flags” to look for that could mean something more serious is going on. A red-flag symptom is one that isn’t usually seen with IBS. If you have one or more, see your doctor. You’ll need tests to find out what’s going on. Red-flag symptoms include:","While several things are known to trigger IBS symptoms, experts don't know what causes the condition. Studies suggest that the colon gets hypersensitive, overreacting to mild stimulation. Instead of slow, rhythmic muscle movements, the bowel muscles spasm. That can cause diarrhea or constipation. Another theory suggests it may involve chemicals made by the body, such as serotonin and gastrin, that control nerve signals between the brain and digestive tract. Other researchers are studying to see if certain bacteria in the bowels can lead to the condition. IBS affects between 25 million and 45 million Americans. Some things seem to make people more likely to have it than others:","There are no specific lab tests that can diagnose IBS. Your doctor will see if your symptoms match with the definition of IBS, and they may run tests to rule out conditions such as: Your doctor may do some of the following tests to decide if you have IBS:","Nearly all people with IBS can get help, but no single treatment works for everyone. You and your doctor will need to work together to find the right treatment plan to manage your symptoms. Many things can trigger IBS symptoms, including certain foods, medicines, the presence of gas or stool, and emotional stress. You’ll need to learn what your triggers are. You may need to make some lifestyle changes and take medication. Diet and lifestyle changes Usually, with a few basic changes in diet and activities, IBS will improve over time. Here are some tips to help ease symptoms:Common food ""triggers"" are red peppers, green onions, red wine, wheat, and cow's milk. If you're concerned about getting enough calcium, you can try to get it from other foods, like broccoli, spinach, turnip greens, tofu, yogurt, sardines, salmon with bones, calcium-fortified orange juice and breads, or calcium supplements. Your doctor may suggest you try something called a low FODMAP diet that cuts down on hard-to-digest carbs such as wheat, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables.   Medications The following types of drugs are used to treat IBS: Other treatments can help with symptoms of IBS: Belly pain and bloating Constipation Diarrhea Make sure to follow your doctor's instructions when taking IBS medications, including laxatives, which can be habit-forming if you don’t use them carefully. 10 questions to ask your doctor Going to the doctor can be intimidating. You might feel rushed and forget to ask questions that are important. It's always a good idea to know what to ask beforehand and to take notes while with the doctor. Some of the questions below may be worth asking. Print out these questions and take them with you to your next appointment: 1. Could some other condition be causing my IBS symptoms? Could I have inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer? 2. Should I keep a diary of my IBS symptoms, and, if so, what should I write down? 3. Should I take laxatives or other over-the-counter medications? If so, what type, and how often is it safe to take them? 4. Would it help my IBS symptoms to add more fiber to my diet? If so, how much and what kind? 5. Are there other dietary changes you would recommend for IBS, and should I consult a dietitian? 6. Could relaxation therapy, counseling, or exercise help my IBS? 7. Should I take prescription medications for my IBS symptoms? If so, what side effects should I expect? 8. Are there any tests you would recommend now or in the future? 9. Are there any other approaches or treatments I should know about? 10. How soon should I have a follow-up appointment?"

Alcohol, drinks with caffeine (like coffee and soda), carbonated drinks, chocolate, sorbitol (an artificial sweetener used in some gums and mints), fried food, and milk products may make IBS-related diarrhea worse. Fiber can be helpful for people who suffer from IBS with constipation (IBS-C). But if you have IBS-D, too much fiber can make your symptoms worse. A low FODMAP diet is often a choice. A form of low carb diet, it limits carbs that are ""fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols"" and are notoriously hard to digest. You may need to experiment to figure out which types of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables agree with your gut. Be sure to drink at least six to eight glasses of water a day because diarrhea can cause dehydration. Stress relief:The link between stress and IBS is complicated.

This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable.","In the inherited forms, symptoms appear at birth or in the first few months of life. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown.

Other signs of ichthyosis are: Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema, a red, itchy rash.","Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it’s passed down to you from your parents. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations to a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body sheds or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in early childhood. If both of your parents have the gene, you’re likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has the gene. Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood.

Your doctor may also do blood testing or ask you to use a device called a peak flow meter. It measures how much air you exhale and how quickly it comes out. It can alert you to changes in your breathing and the onset of asthma symptoms. Ask your asthma doctor if using a peak flow meter would help you narrow down the causes of your asthma. It can be tough to identify them all, and they can change. For example, you might not have been bothered by tree pollen when you were a child, only to have a problem with it as an adult. Even when you know your triggers, you might have a hard time avoiding them in certain situations. For example, you may notice that your workplace is cleaned with a cleaning product that bothers your lungs. That’s why it’s so important to work closely with the doctor who treats your asthma.

These glomeruli (the singular form is glomerulus), normally filter wastes and excess water from the blood and send them to the bladder as urine. The IgA protein prevents this filtering process, leading to blood and protein in the urine and swelling in the hands and feet. This chronic kidney disease may progress over a period of 10 to 20 years. If this disorder leads to end-stage renal disease, the patient must go on dialysis or receive a kidney transplant. The IgA protein is a normal part of the body's system to protect against disease (the immune system). We do not know what causes IgA deposits in the glomeruli. But, since IgA nephropathy may run in families, genetic factors probably contribute to the disease. Kidney disease usually cannot be cured. Once the tiny filtering units are damaged, they cannot be repaired. Treatment focuses on slowing the progression of the disease and preventing complications. One complication is high blood pressure, which further damages glomeruli. Some patients may benefit from limiting protein in their diet to reduce the buildup of waste in the blood. Patients with IgA nephropathy often have high cholesterol. Reducing cholesterol -- through diet, medication, or both -- appears to help slow the progression of IgA nephropathy.",,,,

Immune Hemolytic Anemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia,"Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem.","Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have:  Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice:","You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus. Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are:  ","If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll  also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC, to look for signs of anemia. This test measures:A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these:","If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids, such as hydrocortisone or prednisone, to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place.  Other medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion.Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia. When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath."
Immunizations,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/vaccination-schedule-what-to-expect,"A vaccination schedule is a plan with recommendations for which vaccines your children should get and when they should get them. Vaccines are one of the most important ways to prevent children from getting some dangerous diseases. By exposing you to a germ in a controlled way, vaccines teach your body to recognize and fight it. Government vaccine recommendations are just that -- recommendations. You aren’t forced to get them. But state laws require your kids to have certain vaccines before they can go to daycare, school, or college, with some exceptions. Vaccines protect not just your child, but everyone they come in contact with. The more people who get vaccinated, the harder it is for a disease to spread.

Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include:You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications, from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy, or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes.",,"The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia.

They can include: Problems with your prostate. It’s common for prostate issues to cause urinary incontinence. Your prostate may be larger due to a non-cancerous condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Your prostate may also be bigger than usual because of cancer. An enlarged prostate can block your urethra. When your urethra is blocked, your bladder has to work harder to squeeze pee out. This makes its walls thicker and weaker. That makes it hard for your bladder to empty all the urine in it. You can also struggle with urinary incontinence with prostate cancer or after having certain treatments for it -- such as radiation treatment or surgery to remove your prostate.

You aren’t born with this mutation. It happens when you’re an adult. Some theories are that having a virus or being around toxic chemicals or radiation can cause this to happen. Only in very rare cases do MPDs run in families.",,"These disorders are difficult to cure. Your doctor will typically focus on trying to get your blood cells back to normal levels and reducing the risk for major complications. The treatment depends on which myeloproliferative disorder you have. Some of the most common treatments are: Chemotherapy: Powerful medications are used to kill extra blood cells in your body. You may get this through an IV, or you could be given a pill that you take by mouth.Radiation therapy: High-powered X-rays or other types of radiation can lower the number of blood cells you have and may relieve your symptoms. Phlebotomy: A unit of blood can be removed from you in order to decrease red blood cell counts. Gene therapy: New medications may be able to block or repair the mutated gene that causes MPD. Hormone therapy: Certain hormones can extend the life of your normal blood cells or push your bone marrow to make more. Hormone therapy may also lessen some side effects of MPD. Stem cell transplant: If you have a severe case of MPD, you might be able to have a stem cell transplant. During this procedure, healthy bone marrow, often from a bone marrow donor, is transferred to you. This is the only treatment that has the potential to cure MPD, but it’s not for everyone. Surgery: If your spleen is swollen, it may be removed during a surgery called a splenectomy. Clinical trials: These studies test new cancer treatments to see if they work as well or better than what’s already being used. In some cases, they may be your best choice. You may be among the first to try a new cancer medication or treatment, while helping with a crucial part of cancer research. Watchful waiting: If your MPD is very mild and you have no symptoms, your doctor may also suggest you wait to start any treatment. Some people are fine for several years with only a daily aspirin to prevent blood clots and regular doctor visits.Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) are rare blood cancers that have many different symptoms, yet no clear cause.

Infantile Gaucher Disease,https://www.webmd.com/children/gauchers-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments,"If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. It's a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. Although there's no cure, it's important to keep in mind that depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break it down doesn't work right. The fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, causing problems. There are three main types of Gaucher disease. Type 1 is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe, but some people don't notice any problems at all. There are several treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Type 2 affects the brain and spinal cord. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms usually show up later in childhood.Gaucher disease can have many symptoms, including a swollen belly, bruising, and bleeding. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia. It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones. It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or you're the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support to help you face the challenges ahead. Reach out to your family and friends to get the backing you need. Ask your doctor about how to join a support group, where you can meet other people who are going through the same things you are.","How you feel depends on what type of Gaucher disease you've got. Type 1. It's the most common form. It usually doesn't affect your brain or spinal cord. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is mild and you won't notice any problems. Some symptoms you might have are: Type 2. It affects the brain and spinal cord and is very serious. Babies with this form usually don't live past age 2. The symptoms include: Type 3. This type also affects the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms are similar to type 2, but they usually show up later in childhood and take longer to get worse.Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease. This is the most severe type. An infant with this form usually lives only a few days. These symptoms are overwhelming for a newborn: Cardiovascular Gaucher disease (type 3C). This is rare and mainly affects your heart. You might have symptoms like:","Gaucher disease isn't something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It's an inherited condition that's caused by a problem with the GBA gene. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don't have Gaucher disease.","When you go to your doctor, they might ask:If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child.","How you treat it depends on what type of Gaucher disease you have. Enzyme replacement therapy is one option for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps reduce anemia and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. Enzyme replacement therapy medications may include: Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat (Cerdelga) and miglustat (Zavesca). They are pills that curb the process in your body that forms the fatty materials when you have an enzyme shortage.There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from causing damage to the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease.

Infectious Chorea,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-rheumatic-fever-basics,"A rare but potentially life-threatening disease, rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat caused by bacteria called group A streptococcus. The main symptoms -- fever, muscle aches, swollen and painful joints, and in some cases, a red, lattice-like rash -- typically begin two to four weeks after a bout of strep. In some cases, though, the infection may have been too mild to have been recognized. The knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists are the joints most likely to become swollen from rheumatic fever. The pain often migrates from one joint to another. However, the greatest danger from the disease is the damage it can do to the heart. In more than half of all cases, rheumatic fever scars the valves of the heart, forcing this vital organ to work harder to pump blood. Over a period of months or even years -- particularly if the disease strikes again -- this damage to the heart can lead to a serious condition known as rheumatic heart disease, which can eventually cause the heart to fail.Rheumatic fever can also cause a temporary nervous system disorder once known as St. Vitus' dance, now known as Sydenham's chorea. This is a nervous disorder -- characterized by rapid, jerky, involuntary movements of the body, usually occurring more on one side of the body. People with mild cases of chorea may find it difficult to concentrate or write. More severe cases can cause the muscles of the arms, legs, or face to twitch uncontrollably. It can also be associated with muscle weakness and emotional outbursts. Because of antibiotics, rheumatic fever is now rare in developed countries. In recent years, though, it has begun to make a comeback in the U.S., particularly among children living in poor, inner-city neighborhoods. The disease tends to strike most often in cool, damp weather during the winter and early spring. In the U.S., it is most common in the northern states.",,"Rheumatic fever results from an inflammatory reaction to certain group A streptococcus bacteria. The body produces antibodies to fight the bacteria, but instead the antibodies attack a different target: the body's own tissues. The antibodies begin with the joints and often move on to the heart and surrounding tissues. Because only a small fraction (fewer than 0.3%) of people with strep throat ever contract rheumatic fever, medical experts say that other factors, such as a weakened immune system, must also be involved in the development of the disease.",,
Infectious Mononucleosis,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-mononucleosis-causes,"Mononucleosis is an infectious illness that’s usually caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It’s also called mono or “the kissing disease.” You can get the virus through kissing as well as things like sharing drinks or silverware. It’s contagious, but you’re less likely to catch mono than other common illnesses like a cold. Mono isn’t usually a serious illness, but you can have complications that make it more dangerous. The symptoms of mono can range from mild to severe. You may not be able to take part in your normal daily activities for several weeks.","Mono can cause different symptoms in different people. If you get EBV, you may start to have symptoms of mono within about 4 to 7 weeks. Common symptoms include: Some people have no symptoms or ones that are so mild, they don’t notice them. Most people who get mono feel better in about 2 to 4 weeks. Sometimes, fatigue can last several weeks after that. In some cases, it can take 6 months or longer for the symptoms to go away.","Many people are exposed to EBV as kids. But that doesn’t always mean you’ll get mono. You can carry the virus in your body for your entire life without ever having symptoms of mono. EBV is part of the herpes virus family. Most people are exposed to it at some point in their lives. In the U.S., about 85% to 90% of adults carry the virus by the time they’re 40. ","Your doctor can usually diagnose mono based on your symptoms. They might also check for swelling in your tonsils, lymph nodes, and liver or spleen. They can confirm a mono diagnosis with blood tests including: ",No medications treat mono. Antibiotics and antivirals don’t work on EBV. Things that may help you feel better include: 
Inherited Lipodystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/children/inherited-lipodystrophy,"Lipodystrophy is a problem with the way your body uses and stores fat. It's called ""inherited"" because you're born with it. It comes from the genes you got from one or both of your parents. It makes you lose the fat under your skin, so it can change the way you look. And it can also cause other changes in your body. Scientists have learned a great deal about how this disease works. You can't cure it, but with your doctor's help, the right treatment, a low-fat diet, and plenty of exercise, it's something you can live with. Because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with inherited lipodystrophy often don't have enough of this chemical. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. The condition can also make fat build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. This condition causes other problems, too, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, and fatty liver disease. Inherited lipodystrophy is actually a group of related illnesses. The most common are: ","The two main kinds of inherited lipodystrophy have several subtypes. Each of those has its own specific symptoms. Their severity varies, too. CGL. Babies look very muscular because they have almost no body fat. Most have a large belly button or a hernia, or bulging, around it. They grow fast and are very hungry. Their skin may be dark, thick, and velvety in places, especially at the neck, armpits, and where their legs meet the trunk of their body. Infants usually develop an enlarged liver. Young kids have problems controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. Some children will have trouble thinking and learning.Adults with CGL have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone because their hormone balance is off and they keep growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris, or penis and testicles).","Researchers have found several genes that cause inherited lipodystrophy. That's why there are different subtypes. Sometimes, just one bad gene from one parent can cause it; sometimes, you must get a gene from each parent. It’s also possible to have a bad gene but not get the disease.","Your doctor might ask you these questions:Since lipodystrophy is passed on by genes, your family history is very important. After talking to you and doing a full exam, the doctor may want to do some tests to learn more about what type of lipodystrophy your child has. Blood tests check: Checking your child's blood for leptin won't diagnose lipodystrophy, but it can help your doctor decide how to treat it. Urine tests check for kidney problems. X-rays use radiation in low doses to make images of structures inside their body. These can show bone problems that some people with lipodystrophy have.","Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise, especially if you have FPL, will help you stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up where it shouldn’t.People with CGL may be able to get shots of metreleptin (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women shouldn't use birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of fats worse."
Iron Deficiency Anemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-anemia-basics,"  Anemia is defined as a low number of red blood cells. In a routine blood test, anemia is reported as a low hemoglobin or hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the main protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen, and delivers it throughout your body. If you have anemia, your hemoglobin level will be low too. If it is low enough, your tissues or organs may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue or shortness of breath -- happen because your organs aren't getting what they need to work the way they should. Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects almost 6% of the population. Women, young children, and people with long-term diseases are more likely to have anemia. Important things to remember are: There are many types of anemia. All have different causes and treatments. Some forms -- like the mild anemia that happens during pregnancy -- aren’t a major concern. But some types of anemia may reflect a serious underlying medical condition","The signs of anemia can be so mild that you might not even notice them. At a certain point, as your blood cells decrease, symptoms often develop. Depending on the cause of the anemia, symptoms may include:","There are more than 400 types of anemia, and they’re divided into three groups:Anemia Caused by Blood Loss You can lose red blood cells through bleeding. This can happen slowly over a long period of time, and you might not notice. Causes can include:","A complete blood count (CBC) test will measure your red blood cells, hemoglobin, and other parts of your blood. Your doctor will ask about your family history and your medical history after the CBC. They’ll probably do some tests, including:",Your treatment will depend on your type of anemia. 
Iron Overload Anemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sideroblastic-anemia,"There are two main types of sideroblastic anemia: inherited and acquired.Inherited SA is a rare genetic condition. In other words, you get it from one of your parents. The most common form of inherited SA is known as X-linked sideroblastic anemia. It’s caused by a mutation, or change, in a gene that disrupts normal hemoglobin production. Your body tries to make up for the shortage of hemoglobin by absorbing more iron from food. In the most severe cases, inherited SA can cause organ damage, especially to the liver. Inherited SA is uncommon and is usually diagnosed before age 30. Acquired forms of sideroblastic anemia are more common and are often reversible. Although doctors don’t know the exact cause of acquired SA in most people, you can get the disease by using certain prescription drugs (mainly for tuberculosis) and by drinking alcohol. It’s also caused by extended contact with certain toxic chemicals, or from other illnesses such as immune disorders, tumors, or metabolic diseases. About 10% of people with acquired SA develop leukemia. People with SA (both inherited and acquired) might also develop hemochromatosis, a common iron-overload disease.",,,,"There are several treatment options for SA, but it depends on whether you’re diagnosed with acquired or inherited SA. Your doctor might have you eat more foods or take supplements rich in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Studies show that vitamin B6 may help with both acquired and inherited SA. You can also take medication to get rid of some of the extra iron in your body. Your doctor might consider an infusion of deferoxamine (Desferal) under your skin (subcutaneously) or injected into a muscle (intramuscular). Deferasirox (Exjade) is a pill that also seems to work, but can cause kidney problems. Your doctor can also order a blood transfusion, especially if you don’t respond to vitamin B6 therapy. However, there are drawbacks. A transfusion could make your iron levels worse and lead to liver damage. A bone marrow transplant is the treatment of last resort.If you have anemia, chances are there’s not enough iron inside your blood cells. That lack of iron -- the most common form of anemia -- means you’re also not producing enough hemoglobin, the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. As a result, you don’t feel as energetic as you should. You might become tired, dizzy, or have a tough time falling asleep. However, if your doctor diagnoses you with sideroblastic anemia, also known as SA, you have too much iron in your blood cells. SA forces bone marrow to produce abnormal red blood cells. Those cells contain too much iron, so they can’t effectively make hemoglobin. The symptoms of SA are similar to other types of anemia. You might feel tired, irritable, and find it difficult to breathe. Other symptoms of SA include:"
Irregular Menstrual Periods,https://www.webmd.com/women/abnormal-uterine-bleeding,"Abnormal uterine bleeding is when you bleed outside of your normal monthly period. You might hear it called anovulatory bleeding. Your flow could also be heavier or last longer than what’s typical. When it comes to menstrual cycles, there’s a wide range of “normal.” But your period shouldn’t be a problem for you month after month. If it’s so heavy or unpredictable that it keeps you from doing some activities or makes you miss work or school, you may have a medical condition that should be treated.","The signs of abnormal uterine bleeding include: Doctors check these things when diagnosing abnormal uterine bleeding:If you could be pregnant or you’re past menopause and have any kind of bleeding, call your doctor. Some spotting is common early in pregnancy, but bleeding can be a sign of a serious condition called an ectopic pregnancy. That’s when a fertilized egg implants somewhere outside your uterus, most commonly in a fallopian tube. It could also mean you’re having a miscarriage. After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out.","There are a few possible causes behind abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods.These things can throw off your hormones, too: Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus. Endometriosis can also cause abnormal bleeding. This is when tissue like the kind that lines the inside of your uterus grows outside of your uterus. Other health conditions. These are much less common, but abnormal uterine bleeding also can result from:","It can help to take detailed notes over a few cycles so you can give the doctor specific information about your symptoms. They’ll also ask about your overall health and give you a physical exam. You’ll probably get a pregnancy test, and you may also have:","Your treatment will depend on the cause of the abnormal uterine bleeding -- if a chronic illness or a blood disorder is at the root of your symptoms, treating that can help. Treatment also can depend on whether you plan to have children. It might not be safe to get pregnant after some treatments, while others can make it impossible. If you’re close to menopause, the doctor may want to take a wait-and-see approach because your symptoms may get better on their own. Drugs are usually the first thing your doctor will try. They include: Sometimes surgery can be needed to stop the bleeding:"
Ischemic Necrosis of Bone,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/avascular-necrosis-osteonecrosis-symptoms-treatments,"Avascular necrosis (AVN) is the death of bone tissue due to a loss of blood supply.  You might also hear it called osteonecrosis, aseptic necrosis, or ischemic bone necrosis. If it isn’t treated, AVN can cause the bone to collapse. AVN most often affects your hip. Other possible sites are the shoulder, knees, and ankles.","In its earliest stages, AVN may have no symptoms, but as the disease progresses it typically becomes very painful. At first, it might only hurt when you put pressure on the affected bone. Then, pain may become constant. If the bone and surrounding joint collapse, you may have severe pain that makes you unable to use your joint. The time between the first symptoms and bone collapse can range from several months to more than a year.",Things that can make avascular necrosis more likely include: Other conditions associated with nontraumatic AVN include:,Your doctor will start with a physical exam. They’ll press on your joints to check for tender spots. They’ll move your joints through a series of positions to check your range of motion. You might get one of these imaging tests to look for what’s causing your pain:,"Treatment goals for AVN are to improve the joint, stop the bone damage, and ease pain. The best treatment will depend on a number of things, like: If you catch avascular necrosis early, treatment may involve taking medications to relieve pain or limiting the use of the affected area. If your hip, knee, or ankle is affected, you may need crutches to take weight off the damaged joint. Your doctor may also recommend range-of-motion exercises to help keep the joint mobile."

In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height. Surgeons re-cut the limbs to “stretch” the bones, and braces hold the bones in place. A successful treatment may take several surgeries.

About 60% of babies get it. Jaundice happens when too much bilirubin -- a chemical that red blood cells release during their normal breakdown process -- builds up in the blood. Sometimes it goes away on its own, or your doctor may suggest light therapy or other treatments to knock it out.","The telltale sign of jaundice is a yellow color to your baby's skin and yellow in the whites of their eyes. It typically starts on the face. Once bilirubin levels in the blood get higher, the yellow color moves to the chest and stomach, and then, finally, the legs and arms. Severe jaundice can be an emergency situation, so call your doctor right away if:","Some of the body's red blood cells break down every day and create bilirubin in the blood. It's the liver's job to filter it out of the bloodstream. When your baby is still in your womb, your liver clears out their bilirubin for them. After birth, your baby's liver takes over. Sometimes, your newborn's liver can't break down bilirubin as quickly as their body makes it, and it starts to build up. Because bilirubin is a yellow compound, it turns your baby's skin and eyes yellow. Babies have a greater chance of getting jaundice if they’re:Jaundice typically shows up 2 or 3 days after your baby is born and goes away within the first couple of weeks. Some types may show up sooner or much later.   Breastfeeding jaundice happens because your baby isn’t eating enough. Your milk may not have come in yet or your baby is having trouble latching on. The more your baby eats, the more quickly their body clears waste, including bilirubin, from their system. Breast milk jaundice appears after the first week. Doctors don’t know exactly why it happens, but they think something in breast milk keeps your baby’s liver from processing bilirubin effectively. This kind of jaundice can last for several months. More serious kinds of jaundice are caused by a disease or condition, such as:","Usually, a doctor can tell your baby has jaundice by looking.

Other types of newborn jaundice can be due to prematurity, problems related to breastfeeding, infection, blood type mismatch between mom and baby as well as other blood or liver problems.Since many mothers and babies leave the hospital soon after delivery, jaundice may not appear until babies are at home. A newborn check is typically scheduled with your pediatrician to check for jaundice within the first few days of going home from the hospital.   It is important to contact your doctor if you notice signs of jaundice in your baby.

Jaundice caused by biliary atresia lasts longer than that. Their abdomen also may swell, they'll have gray or white stools, and their pee will be dark. This happens because their liver can't process bilirubin -- a reddish-brown substance that's made when red blood cells break down. It's what gives poop its brown color. Some babies also might have frequent nosebleeds or intense itching.","Doctors believe a number of things may trigger biliary atresia, including: It isn't passed down from one family member to another, and babies can't catch it from someone else. Girls who are born prematurely are most at risk. So are Asian and African-American babies.","Many liver conditions have the same symptoms as biliary atresia. To make sure they find the right cause, your child's doctor may test their blood for high levels of bilirubin. They may also do some or all of the following:","The most common treatment is the Kasai procedure. It's done if the blocked bile ducts are outside the baby's liver. During the operation, your baby's surgeon will replace the blocked bile ducts with part of their intestine. This lets bile drain from their liver through the new ""duct"" and into their intestine.If it's done before your baby is 3 months old, the surgery has about an 80% success rate. If it's not successful, babies usually need a liver transplant within 1 to 2 years. If the blocked bile ducts are inside the liver, medication may help get rid of bile, and vitamin A, D, and E supplements may be prescribed. But a liver transplant probably will be needed."

This donor can be living or deceased. After the procedure, you take medicine for the rest of your life to make sure that your body doesn't reject your new kidney."

However, certain groups are at higher risk, including:",,"For patients who have high blood pressure and kidney disease, the most important treatment is to control your blood pressure through lifestyle changes. ACE inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) drugs lower blood pressure and can protect the kidneys from further damage, especially in people with diabetes. However, treatments need to be individualized.High blood pressure (hypertension) is a leading cause of kidney disease and kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels and filters in the kidney, making removal of waste from the body difficult. Once a person is diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, dialysis -- a blood-cleansing process -- or kidney transplantation are necessary."
"Kidney Failure, Acute",https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-acute-kidney-failure,"Acute kidney failure is when your kidneys stop working suddenly. Doctors sometimes call it acute renal failure. It can happen over just a few hours or days. Acute kidney failure isn’t always permanent. If you get treatment right away -- and if you don’t have other serious health problems -- your kidneys can go back to working normally. The main job of your kidneys is to filter waste out of your blood. They also remove extra fluid from your blood (this becomes urine) and control blood pressure. Kidneys help make red blood cells. They regulate electrolytes (a type of nutrient) and activate vitamin D, too. Kidneys don’t work well when they’re damaged. This could happen because of another health condition, like diabetes. A decrease in kidney function that happens over a longer period of time is called chronic kidney disease (CKD).","You may not have any symptoms of acute kidney failure. Your doctor may discover you have this condition while doing lab tests for another reason. If you do have symptoms, they’ll depend on how bad your loss of kidney function is, how quickly you lose kidney function, and the reasons for your kidney failure. Symptoms may include:","Most of the time, kidney failure happens along with another medical condition or event. If you fall into any of the following categories, you may have a greater chance of acute kidney failure:","Your doctor will start with a physical exam. Then, they’ll order tests of your blood, urine, and kidneys. Blood tests. These measure substances in your blood. Urine tests. Your doctor will check your pee for blood and protein. They’ll also look for certain electrolytes. The results help your doctor understand what’s causing your kidney failure. Kidney biopsy (renal biopsy) is a procedure where the doctor pushes a thin needle through your skin and takes a small piece of your kidney to look at under a microscope.  It can show if there is any damage or disease in your kidney, and frequently what the cause is. This is typically done only in cases where it is unclear what is causing the kidney failure. Imaging tests. Some tests, like ultrasonography or a CT scan, can show whether your kidneys are enlarged or there’s a blockage in your urine flow. They can also tell your doctor if there is any problem with arteries or veins going in and out of your kidneys. An MRI can show this, too.","Often, treatment for acute kidney failure, especially if severe, requires hospitalization. If there aren’t any other problems, the kidneys may heal themselves. In most other cases, acute kidney failure can be treated if it’s caught early. It may involve changes to your diet, the use of medications, intravenous fluids, relief of any obstruction that is blocking kidneys, or even dialysis."
Klinefelter Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/men/klinefelter-syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition in which a boy is born with an extra X chromosome.

There’s no cure, but it can be treated.","Some men show symptoms of Klinefelter as children, but others don’t know they have it until puberty or adulthood. Many men never realize that they have it because symptoms aren’t always present. Symptoms of Klinefelter vary with age and include: Babies:  Children:  Teenagers:  Adults: ","You get the extra X chromosome by chance. Either the egg or the sperm that came together to create you had an extra X chromosome. Older women have a slightly higher chance of having a boy with XXY syndrome, but the chance is small. Men with Klinefelter may have:","To diagnose Klinefelter syndrome, your doctor will start with a physical exam and questions about your symptoms and general health. They’ll probably examine your chest, penis, and testicles and do a few simple tests, such as checking your reflexes. Your doctor may then run two main tests:","It’s never too late to treat Klinefelter, but the earlier you start, the better. One common treatment is testosterone replacement therapy. It can start at puberty and can spur typical body changes, such as facial hair and a deeper voice. It can also help with penis size and stronger muscles and bones, but it won’t affect testicle size or fertility.

The implants, as they are called, are made from a variety of materials, including metal, ceramic, or plastic. They are built to allow easy movement. Some implants are made just for women -- to closely match their anatomy. A common artificial knee design replaces the PCL (posterior cruciate ligament), located in the back of the knee.

With some lab tests, you’re supposed to fast (not eat), or not do certain activities, eat certain foods, or take certain drugs. If you forget and mess up, don’t worry -- just tell your doctor before you do the test. It’s not a big deal to reschedule, and it’s a waste of time to get the test if the results won’t be right. Make sure your doctor always uses the same lab to do your tests if possible. It can be hard to compare results from different labs because they may approach the test differently. For example, one lab might have different ranges for “normal” and “abnormal” than another.

Labor and Delivery,https://www.webmd.com/baby/labor-signs,"Labor is another word for your body’s natural process of childbirth. It starts with your first steady contractions and goes through the delivery of both your baby and placenta. Some pregnant people have very distinct signs of labor, while others don’t. No one knows what causes labor to start or when it will start, but several hormonal and physical changes help indicate the beginning of labor. Lightening during labor The process of your baby settling or lowering into your pelvis just before labor is called lightening. It’s also referred to as the baby “dropping.” Passing of the mucus plug The mucus plug accumulates at the cervix during pregnancy. When the cervix begins to open wider, the mucus is discharged into the vagina. It may be clear, pink, or slightly bloody. This is also known as “show” or “bloody show.” Labor may begin soon after the mucus plug is discharged or 1 to 2 weeks later.Labor contractions Contractions are the tightening of the muscles of the uterus.

Labor and Delivery Complications,https://www.webmd.com/baby/understanding-labor-delivery-complications-basics,"A pregnancy that has gone smoothly can still have problems when it's time to deliver the baby. Your doctor and hospital are prepared to handle them. Here are some of the most common concerns: Preterm labor and premature delivery One of the greatest dangers babies face is being born too early, before their body is mature enough to survive outside the womb. The lungs, for example, may not be able to breathe air, or the baby's body may not generate enough heat to keep warm. A full-term pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks. Having labor contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy is called preterm labor. Also, a baby born before 37 weeks is considered a premature baby who is at risk of complications of prematurity, such as immature lungs, respiratory distress, and digestive problems. Drugs and other treatments can be used to stop preterm labor. If these treatments fail, intensive care can keep many premature babies alive. The symptoms of preterm labor and birth include:Call you doctor if you notice or feel any of those symptoms. Protracted labor Protracted labor refers to cervical dilation that is abnormally slow or to abnormally slow fetal descent. This means the labor does not progress as fast as it should. This could happen with a big baby, a baby in a breech position (buttocks down), or other abnormal presentation, or with a uterus that does not contract strongly enough. Often, there is no specific cause for protracted labor. Both the mother and the baby are at risk for several complications, including infections, if the amniotic sac has been ruptured for a long time and the birth doesn't follow.",,,,

Mastitis can also happen if you don't feed or pump regularly. Breastfeeding women aren't the only ones who get mastitis. If you're not breastfeeding, a cracked nipple or nipple piercing can cause the breast infection. Both allow bacteria to get into the milk ducts. This is especially common in women who smoke.","Just like any other infection, the tissue around the infected area becomes inflamed to keep it from spreading to other parts of the body. With mastitis, the infected milk duct causes the breast to swell. Your breast may look red and feel tender or warm. Many women with mastitis feel like they have the flu, including achiness, chills, and a fever of 101 F or higher.

There are two things to rule out: a breast abscess, which happens when mastitis isn't treated quickly, and inflammatory breast cancer, which is rare and shares the symptoms of redness and swelling.","Whether or not you're breastfeeding, antibiotics should have you feeling better in a day or two. Take them as directed. If you are breastfeeding, continue drinking lots of water, wearing loose bras, and resting as much as you can. Your doctor may suggest ibuprofen, or something like it, to take care of the fever and pain.

LAM,https://www.webmd.com/lung/lam-lung-disease-lymphangioleiomyomatosis,"No one knows what causes pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Estrogen seems to be involved, because women rarely develop LAM before puberty or after menopause. Fewer than 10 men are known to have ever developed LAM lung disease. Smoking isn't known to cause LAM: more than half of people with LAM lung disease have never smoked. LAM is so rare that it's unknown how often it really occurs. For example, during a three-year study by researchers, fewer than 250 people with LAM were identified in the U.S. Fewer than 2,000 women are known to have LAM today. LAM is not cancer, but appears similar to other conditions in which benign tumors grow uncontrollably. LAM lung disease shares some features with a different condition called tuberous sclerosis.","Most people with LAM lung disease experience shortness of breath. Other symptoms include wheezing and cough, which may be bloody. Often, people with LAM develop a sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This occurs when one of the cysts near the lung's edge ruptures, allowing inhaled air to compress the lung. A pneumothorax usually causes pain and shortness of breath. If muscle cells migrate to areas outside the lungs, LAM can cause other symptoms: In a few people with LAM, discovery of these benign tumors outside the lungs is the first sign of LAM lung disease.","No one knows what causes pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Tests frequently performed include: It's possible to diagnose LAM lung disease based on a woman's history and findings on high-resolution CT scan. But doctors often recommend collecting a sample of lung tissue (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis. Lung biopsies can be collected in different ways: A physician (pathologist) then examines lung biopsy tissue, helping make the diagnosis of LAM lung disease with greater certainty.","The drug sirolimus (Rapamune) is the first drug approved to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The drug has been found to help improve the lung capacity in patients, allowing them to breathe easier. In addition, inhaled bronchodilators (albuterol, ipratropium) can help open the airways, reducing shortness of breath in some people. Patients with LAM lung disease should avoid smoking cigarettes as well as second hand smoke. Because hormones like estrogen seem to be involved in LAM lung disease, treatments that manipulate hormone levels could help some people with LAM. A number of hormone-related treatments have been tested in women with LAM lung disease: In clinical trials that tested these therapies, some women were helped, but others were not. People who experience pneumothorax generally must undergo procedures to reinflate the collapsed lung, and prevent its recurrence. If pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis progresses and becomes disabling, lung transplantation may be an option. Though it's a drastic treatment, most people undergoing lung transplant for LAM lung disease gain improved lung function and quality of life after surgery."
Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-myasthenia-gravis-basics,"Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength.","The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication.","Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors.Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present.","To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include:","Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include:If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus. A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options:"
Lamellar Ichthyosis,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-is-ichthyosis,"Ichthyosis is a group of about 20 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish, because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable.","In the inherited forms, symptoms appear at birth or in the first few months of life. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis are: Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema, a red, itchy rash.","Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it’s passed down to you from your parents. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations to a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body sheds or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in early childhood. If both of your parents have the gene, you’re likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has the gene. Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don’t know what causes it, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Some medicines might also trigger the condition:","Sometimes it’s so mild that it looks like regular dry skin. If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist -- a doctor who treats skin problems -- for treatment. They may:","It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin.Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin, alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist."

LGMD,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan.

They’ll likely hurt the most when you eat or drink foods that are spicy, salty, acidic (orange juice, tomatoes), or alcoholic. Crispy treats and drinks with caffeine can also cause problems. Your doctor can diagnose oral lichen planus by taking a small piece of skin from inside your mouth. This is called a biopsy. They’ll run tests on it in the lab to see what the problem is. You may also need blood tests to rule out other conditions.","Doctors aren't sure what causes oral lichen planus, but several things could play a part: ",,"If you feel only a slight roughness in your mouth, you may not need treatment. If you’re in pain or have sores, your doctor may suggest a corticosteroid cream. In rare cases, they might prescribe steroid pills. If your doctor suspects your immune system is causing your symptoms, they may suggest a medication that turns down its normal response. These include: "
Lichen Sclerosus,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/lichen-sclerosis,"Doctors don’t know why some people get lichen sclerosus. They think it may be due to genes, hormones, an infection, or some combination of these things. Another theory is that your immune system attacks your skin. It may even be caused by an old skin injury.","If you have it, you may notice small, shiny, and smooth white patches on your skin. These patches can become bigger and the skin may become thin and wrinkled. Your skin may tear easily, causing large bruises (which may be red or purple) to appear. Itching is very common.

That means they will remove a small piece of your skin and send it to a lab to be viewed under a microscope. This will confirm or rule out the diagnosis.","Although there’s no cure for lichen sclerosus, there are treatments that can help. If you have it on your genitals, you should get it treated, even if you don’t have symptoms. When left untreated, it can lead to problems with sex or urination. Patches on other parts of the body usually go away with time.Your doctor will probably first give you a steroid cream to put on the problem area. This can stop the itching. But it may take longer -- a few weeks or months --for the skin to return to a more normal appearance. You may need to use these creams or ointments for a long period of time to keep the condition from coming back. You’ll need to keep up with your doctor appointments, since long-term use of steroid creams or ointments can make the skin become red or thin and cause stretch marks. The treatment can also cause genital yeast infections. If the cortisone cream or ointment doesn’t work for you, there are other treatment options. They include vitamin A-like drugs called retinoids, ultraviolet light therapy, or tacrolimus ointment. Tacrolimus ointment, as well as one called pimecrolimus ointment, are creams that help your immune system recognize lichen sclerosus as an invader."

Sometimes, food getting caught inside the extra-long papillae can cause bad breath.","A black hairy tongue is caused by too much bacteria or yeast growth in the mouth. The bacteria build up on tiny rounded projections called papillae. These lie along the surface of the tongue. Instead of shedding as they normally do, the papillae start to grow and lengthen, creating hair-like projections. They can grow to 15 times their normal length. Normally, the papillae are pinkish-white. But as they grow, pigments from food, drinks, and possibly the bacteria or yeast themselves get caught in the papillae, dyeing the tongue a color. Most often that color is black, hence the name. But the tongue can also turn brown, yellow, green, or a variety of other colors. Certain lifestyle habits and conditions can make people more likely to develop black hairy tongue. They include: Black hairy tongue is more common in men, people who use intravenous drugs, and those who are HIV-positive.",,"Practicing good oral hygiene is the best way to treat black hairy tongue. Gently brush your teeth twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Also, brush your tongue. You can use a tongue scraper to make sure you're thoroughly cleaning the area. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to help keep your mouth clean.Other tips include: Call your doctor or dentist if the problem doesn't get better on its own. Your doctor may prescribe antibiotics or an antifungal drug to get rid of the bacteria or yeast. Topical medications, such as tretinoin (Retin-A), are also sometimes prescribed. As a last resort, if the problem doesn't improve, the papillae can be surgically clipped off with a laser or electrosurgery.The name black hairy tongue may sound scary, but the condition is harmless. Black hairy tongue is caused by bacteria or fungi in the mouth, which make the tongue appear black and hairy. It's easily remedied by good old-fashioned oral hygiene."

Lipodystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/acquired-lipodystrophy,"However, because fat tissue makes the hormone leptin, people with larger areas of acquired lipodystrophy might not have enough of this chemical in their bodies. Leptin tells your body you've eaten enough and to make insulin. Fat could also build up in places it shouldn't, like the blood, heart, liver, and kidneys. Depending on which type of lipodystrophy a person has, it may cause other problems, including diabetes, high cholesterol and triglycerides, liver disease, and kidney failure. Doctors can help you manage these complications. And cosmetic surgery might be an option if looks are a concern.","While all kinds of acquired lipodystrophy cause a loss of body fat, exactly what that means for each person is different. The type your child has will affect: AGL. They'll lose fat from under the skin all over their body, including their face, arms, legs, palms, and sometimes the soles of their feet. They could look very muscular, and you’ll be able to see veins under their skin. Kids with AGL are very hungry all the time and grow fast. Adults may have large hands and feet and a strong, square jawbone if their hormone balance is off and they've kept growing. They could have larger than usual sex organs (clitoris and ovaries, penis and testicles). A woman might have irregular periods or none at all. They could have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). They'll probably have extra hair on their upper lip and chin. Some people with AGL have patches of dark, velvety skin in their underarms, on their neck, around their belly button or nipples, or on their hands and feet.Because of the fat loss, a person may have problems using sugar in their body or controlling their blood sugar and triglyceride levels. They could have a large liver or spleen. APL. This type affects just the upper body, on both sides. It usually starts with their face and moves to their neck, arms, and chest. Localized. This looks like a dent in the skin, but the skin itself seems fine. The size can vary. It could be in one spot or many. There might also be tender or painful bumps.","Often, doctors don't know what causes acquired lipodystrophy, but some triggers are: For example, people with diabetes who have to inject insulin daily tend to get localized lipodystrophy where they keep giving themselves shots. That's a good reason to change your injection site often.","When you go to the doctor, they'll do a full exam and ask questions about your child’s health:Tests of body fat can confirm the diagnosis. For a skin biopsy, the doctor will cut a small piece of skin and check the cells under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for a pattern of fat loss with: Blood tests check: If the doctor suspects APL, they'll check their blood for evidence of a specific way the body attacks fat cells. Urine tests check for kidney problems.","Since you can't replace the missing body fat, your aim will be to avoid complications of the disease. A healthy lifestyle plays a big role. Everyone with lipodystrophy should eat a low-fat diet. But children still need enough calories and good nutrition so they grow properly. Exercise will help your child stay healthy, too. Physical activity lowers blood sugar and can keep fat from building up dangerously. People with AGL may be able to get metreleptin injections (Myalept) to replace the missing leptin and help prevent other diseases. Statins and omega-3 fatty acids, found in some fish, can help control high cholesterol or triglycerides, too. If your child has or gets diabetes, they'll need to take insulin or other drugs to control their blood sugar. Women with AGL shouldn't use oral birth control or hormone replacement therapy for menopause because they can make levels of certain fats worse.Your doctor may prescribe a lotion or cream to lighten and soften dark skin patches. Over-the-counter bleaches and skin scrubs probably won't work and could irritate the skin. As your child gets older, they may be able to get plastic surgery to help fill out their face with skin grafts from their thighs, belly, or scalp. Doctors can also use implants and injections of fillers to help reshape facial features. People with APL who have extra fat deposits can use liposuction to get rid of some, but fat may build up again. Talk to your doctor about what approach for their appearance makes sense and when."
Lipoma,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-is-a-lipoma,"A lipoma is a lump of fat that grows in your body’s soft tissues. Though it’s classified as a tumor, it’s usually harmless.

You most often find them in your upper body, arms, or thighs.","They usually appear as small, soft lumps. They’re typically less than 2 inches wide. You could have more than one. When you press on the lipoma, it may feel doughy. It will move easily with finger pressure. They don’t normally hurt, but they can cause pain if they bump against nearby nerves or have blood vessels running through them.","It isn’t clear what causes them. Middle-aged men and women tend to get them more. They also run in families. Lipomas often show up after an injury, though doctors don’t know whether that’s what makes them form. Inherited conditions can bring them on. Some people who have a rare condition known as Madelung’s disease can get them. This most often affects men of Mediterranean ancestry who have alcohol use disorder.","Lipomas can usually be diagnosed with a physical exam. But you may need a biopsy, in which a small piece of the tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope, to confirm the diagnosis. Tests like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can also give a clearer picture.","Since lipomas aren’t harmful, doctors often leave them alone. You may need to keep an eye on it between visits.If one hurts or you don’t like the way it looks, you might want to have it removed. Your doctor can take it out surgically with a small cut.

Liver Cancer,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-basic-information,"The liver continuously filters blood that circulates through the body, converting nutrients and drugs absorbed from the digestive tract into ready-to-use chemicals. The liver performs many other important functions, such as removing toxins and other chemical waste products from the blood and readying them for excretion. Because all the blood in the body must pass through it, the liver is unusually accessible to cancer cells traveling in the bloodstream.   The liver can be affected by primary liver cancer, which arises in the liver, or by cancer which forms in other parts of the body and then spreads to the liver. Most liver cancer is secondary or metastatic, meaning it started elsewhere in the body. Primary liver cancer, which starts in the liver, accounts for about 2% of cancers in the U.S., but up to half of all cancers in some undeveloped countries. This is mainly due to the prevalence of hepatitis, caused by contagious viruses, that predisposes a person to liver cancer. In the U.S., primary liver cancer strikes twice as many men as women, at an average age of 67.Because the liver is made up of several different types of cells, several types of tumors can form there. Some of these are benign (noncancerous), and some are cancerous and can spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). These tumors have different causes and are treated differently. The outlook for health or recovery depends on what type of tumor you have. The more common benign tumors of the liver include: None of these tumors are treated like liver cancer. They may need to be removed surgically if they cause pain or bleeding. Liver cancers include: This article discusses hepatocellular carcinoma. It's important to know what type of liver tumor you have. Be sure to get that information from your healthcare provider.",,"Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) tends to occur in livers damaged by birth defects, alcohol abuse, or chronic infection with diseases such as hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis (a hereditary disease associated with too much iron in the liver), and cirrhosis. More than half of all people diagnosed with primary liver cancer have cirrhosis -- a scarring condition of the liver commonly caused by alcohol abuse. Hepatitis B and C and hemochromatosis can cause permanent damage and liver failure. Liver cancer may also be linked to obesity and fatty liver disease.Various cancer-causing substances are associated with primary liver cancer, including certain herbicides and chemicals such as vinyl chloride and arsenic. Smoking, especially if you abuse alcohol as well, also increases risk. Aflatoxins, cancer-causing substances made by a type of plant mold, have also been implicated. Aflatoxins can contaminate wheat, peanuts, rice, corn, and soybeans.

Liver Cancer Treatment,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/understanding-liver-cancer-treatment,"Any liver cancer is difficult to cure. Primary liver cancer is rarely detectable early, when it is most treatable. Secondary or metastatic liver cancer is hard to treat because it has already spread.

Patients with early-stage tumors that can be removed surgically have the best chance of long-term survival. Unfortunately, most liver cancers are inoperable at the time it's diagnosed, either because the cancer is too advanced or the liver is too diseased to permit surgery. In some patients, chemotherapy is given directly into the liver (chemoembolization) to reduce tumors to a size that may make surgery possible. This may also be done without chemotherapy (bland embolization) in some cases, using ethanol instead. Patients in remission must be monitored closely for potential recurrence.Cryotherapy, or freezing the tumor, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), using radio waves to destroy the tumor, may be used to treat some cases of liver cancer. Radiation therapy can be given in various ways, but has its limitations due to the liver's low tolerance to radiation.

The kind you have depends on where your blisters tend to form. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex: The most common type, it first shows up in newborns. It mainly affects the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should. Sometimes this type doesn’t show up until early childhood.Kindler syndrome: This is a mixed condition, since blisters appear across different skin layers. It can also cause patchy changes in your skin coloring when it’s exposed to the sun. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita: This form causes blisters on your hands and feet as well as in mucous membranes like the mouth.","Usually, signs of epidermolysis bullosa first appear in babies or toddlers. Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder. If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.","Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system.","To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.","There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."
Lou Gehrig's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-als-basics,There are two types of ALS:,,"Researchers still don't know exactly what causes motor neurons to die with ALS. Gene changes, or mutations, are behind 5% to 10% of ALS cases. More than 12 different gene changes have been linked to ALS.One change is to a gene that makes a protein called SOD1. This protein may be toxic to motor neurons. Other gene changes in ALS might also damage motor neurons. Environment could also play a role in ALS. Scientists are studying whether people who come into contact with certain chemicals or germs are more likely to get the disease. For example, people who served in the military during the 1991 Gulf War have gotten ALS at higher rates than usual. Scientists are also looking at these other possible causes: Researchers learn more about ALS every day. What they discover will help them develop medications to treat symptoms and improve the lives of people who have this disease.ALS is short for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. You might also have heard it called Lou Gehrig's disease, after the baseball player who was diagnosed with it in the 1930s. A French doctor named Jean-Martin Charcot discovered the condition in 1869. ALS is a progressive disease, which means it gets worse over time. It affects nerves in your brain and spinal cord that control your muscles.

Low Back Pain,https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/pain-management-back-pain,"The causes of back pain can be complex. Some causes of back pain include accidents, muscle strains, and sports injuries.","The main symptom of cervical radiculopathy is pain that spreads into the arm, neck, chest, and/or shoulders. A person with radiculopathy may experience muscle weakness and/or numbness or tingling in fingers or hands. Other symptoms may include lack of coordination, especially in the hands.","In cervical radiculopathy, damage can occur as a result of pressure from material from a ruptured disc, degenerative changes in bones, arthritis, or other injuries that put pressure on the nerve roots. In older people, normal degenerative changes in the discs can cause pressure on nerve roots. In younger people, cervical radiculopathy tends to be the result of a ruptured disc. This disc material then compresses the nerve root, causing pain.",,"Cervical radiculopathy may be treated with a combination of pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), or nonsteroidal pain medication such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), ketoprofen (Frotek), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and physical therapy. Steroids may be prescribed either orally or injected epidurally (into the epidural space that surrounds the spinal cord).   Physical therapy might include gentle cervical traction and mobilization, exercises, and other modalities to reduce pain.   If significant compression on the nerve exists to the extent that motor weakness results, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pressure.    There can be many causes of back pain including accidents, strains, and injuries. Two types of back injury are spondylolisthesis and cervical radiculopathy. Both have their own set of symptoms, causes, and treatments. The spine, or backbone, is made up of a column of 33 bones and tissue extending from the skull to the pelvis.

Your doctor will check beforehand to see if and what type of devices you may have and if it’s OK for you to get a scan. Devices that aren’t or may not be compatible with MRI include: Implants such as pacemakers, cochlear implants, stents and artificial joints. If you have any of these, your doctor or the MRI technologist may ask for the make and model of the device to see whether it’s safe for you to get an MRI. Metal objects such as surgical clips, plates, screws or wire mesh. If you have these you may not be able to get an MRI on that part of your body. External devices like an external insulin pump, leg brace, ventilator, patient monitor or wound dressing. They may prevent you from getting an MRI. Other risks of MRI include: Claustrophobia. Some people get this from having to go into the MRI tube or tunnel. You can take anti-anxiety medication ahead of the procedure to help with this or try an open MRI machine.  Allergic reaction or sensitivity to contrast dye.Sometimes doctors use dyes with MRIs. Some people are allergic to these chemicals and shouldn’t get MRIs. Possible effect on pregnancy/unborn child. There’s no evidence that an MRI has any adverse effect on a baby. However, doctors usually try to avoid MRIs during the first trimester of pregnancy. Thermal Injuries or burns.An implanted medical device could heat up and burn you. Or you might come into contact with heated coils or cables in the scanner.

Low Blood Pressure,https://www.webmd.com/heart/understanding-low-blood-pressure-basics,"Hypotension is the medical term for low blood pressure (less than 90/60). A blood pressure reading appears as two numbers. The first and higher of the two is a measure of systolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills them with blood. The second number measures diastolic pressure, or the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. Optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 (systolic/diastolic). In healthy people, low blood pressure without any symptoms is not usually a concern and does not need to be treated. But low blood pressure can be a sign of an underlying problem -- especially in the elderly -- where it may cause inadequate blood flow to the heart, brain, and other vital organs.Chronic low blood pressure with no symptoms is almost never serious. But health problems can occur when blood pressure drops suddenly and the brain is deprived of an adequate blood supply. This can lead to dizziness or lightheadedness. Sudden drops in blood pressure most commonly occur in someone who's rising from a lying down or sitting position to standing. This kind of low blood pressure is known as postural hypotension or orthostatic hypotension. Another type of low blood pressure can occur when someone stands for a long period of time. This is called neurally mediated hypotension.   Postural hypotension is considered a failure of the cardiovascular system or nervous system to react appropriately to sudden changes. Normally, when you stand up, some blood pools in your lower extremities. Uncorrected, this would cause your blood pressure to fall. But your body normally compensates by sending messages to your heart to beat faster and to your blood vessels to constrict. This offsets the drop in blood pressure. If this does not happen, or happens too slowly, postural hypotension results and can lead to fainting.",,"The cause of low blood pressure isn't always clear. It may be associated with the following: What Causes a Sudden Drop in Blood Pressure? Sudden drops in blood pressure can be life-threatening. Causes of this type of hypotension include:Who Gets Postural Hypotension? Postural hypotension, which is low blood pressure when standing up suddenly, can happen to anyone for a variety of reasons, such as dehydration, lack of food, or being overly fatigued. It can also be influenced by genetic make-up, aging, medication, dietary and psychological factors, and acute triggers, such as infection and allergy. Postural hypotension occurs most frequently in people who are taking drugs to control high blood pressure (hypertension). It can also be related to pregnancy, strong emotions, hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), or diabetes. The elderly are particularly affected, especially those who have high blood pressure or autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Hypotension after meals is a common cause of dizziness and falls after eating. This is most common after large meals containing a lot of carbohydrates. It’s believed to be caused by blood pooling into the vessels of the stomach and intestines. Several drugs are commonly associated with postural hypotension. These medications can be divided into two major categories:",,
Low Potassium Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/hypokalemia,"There are many different reasons you could have low potassium levels.

Other things sometimes cause it, too, like: Several syndromes can be associated with low potassium, such as: Women tend to get hypokalemia more often than men.","If your problem is temporary, or you’re only slightly hypokalemic, you might not feel any symptoms. Once your potassium levels fall below a certain level, you might experience: Hypokalemia can affect your kidneys. You may have to go to the bathroom more often. You may also feel thirsty. You may notice muscle problems during exercise. In severe cases, muscle weakness can lead to paralysis and possibly respiratory failure.","There are many different reasons you could have low potassium levels.

They will ask you about your health history. They’ll want to know if you’ve had any illness that involved vomiting or diarrhea. They’ll ask about any conditions you might have that could be causing it. You may take a urine test so your doctor can find out if you’re losing potassium when you pee. Since low potassium sometimes can affect your blood pressure, your doctor will check that, too. They also may want to do an electrocardiogram (EKG) if they think you may have arrhythmia. This is one of the more serious side effects, and might change the way your doctor chooses to treat the problem.","You can get more potassium by taking supplements. Most of these you can take by mouth. In some cases it’s necessary to get your potassium injected by IV. For example: When your hypokalemia is a result of another medical condition, your doctor will help you treat that. If you have low potassium because of diuretics, they may take you off them. Sometimes that makes the condition go away. Always check with your doctor before you stop any medicine. Also, ask them before you take any potassium supplements. This might cause too much potassium to build up in your system, which could lead to hyperkalemia.If you have hypokalemia, that means you have low levels of potassium in your blood. Potassium is a mineral your body needs to work normally. It helps muscles to move, cells to get the nutrients they need, and nerves to send their signals. It’s especially important for cells in your heart. It also helps keep your blood pressure from getting too high."

Lumbar Pain,https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/understanding-back-pain-basics,"We often bring on our back problems through bad habits, such as: The spine is actually a stack of 24 bones called vertebrae. A healthy spine is S-shaped when viewed from the side. It curves back at your shoulders and inward at your neck and small of your back. It houses and protects your spinal cord, the network of nerves that transmit feeling and control movement throughout your entire body.  One of the more common types of back pain comes from straining the bands of muscles surrounding the spine. It happens most often in the curve of the low back and the base of the neck. These areas support more weight than your upper and mid back, which are less prone to trouble. Injuries from contact sports, accidents, and falls can cause problems ranging from minor muscle strains, to herniated disks, to fractures that damage the spinal column or cord. Stabbing low back pain could be from muscle spasms, when your muscles seize up and don't relax, like a cramp. Osteoarthritis can affect your vertebrae, when the cartilage between them wears down. Bone spurs or a herniated disk can push on nerves. Pregnancy often brings on back pain, too. Hormonal changes and weight gain put new kinds of stresses on a pregnant woman's spine and legs. Sometimes your back might be sore for no clear reason. That's called nonspecific backache. It could come from weak muscles that can't handle everyday walking, bending, and stretching.","Back pain -- whether a dull ache or shooting -- is just one sign that something's going on with your back.

Lung Carcinoid Tumors,https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/lung-carcinoid-tumors,"It’s important for you to know what kind of carcinoid tumor you have to get the best treatment. Carcinoid tumors are divided in two types: typical and atypical. Typical carcinoid tumors are the most common. About 9 out of 10 carcinoid tumors are called typical. They grow slowly, and they don’t usually spread outside of the lungs. Atypical carcinoid tumors grow faster, and they’re more likely to spread, or metastasize, outside of the lungs. Doctors also refer to lung carcinoid tumors based on their location. If your tumors are in the walls of the large airways of your lungs, they’re central carcinoids. If they’re found in the smaller airways closer to the edges of your lungs, they’re peripheral carcinoids. The outlook is often good. Among people with typical carcinoid tumors of the lung, about 85% to 90% live another 5 years or more, as do 50% to 70% of those with atypical carcinoids.","You may not have any symptoms. Around 25% of people with these tumors don’t. Your doctor may discover them when you have tests for something else.Carcinoid tumors in the lung may cause: Sometimes carcinoid tumors cause a condition called carcinoid syndrome. That’s due to the hormones released by the cells in the tumors. Symptoms may include flushing of your face and neck, diarrhea, fast heart rate, and weight gain.","Researchers don’t really know the causes of carcinoid tumors in the lung. They have found that typical carcinoids don’t seem to be linked to smoking, but atypical carcinoid tumors are found more often in people who do smoke. You may be at a higher risk for these rare tumors with: Age. You can get carcinoid tumors at any age, but they happen most often in people 45 to 55 years old. Gender. Carcinoid tumors are more common in women than in men. Race/ethnicity. These tumors are more common in whites than in other racial and ethnic groups. Family history. Your risk is higher if you have family members with carcinoid tumors. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. This inherited syndrome raises your chances of getting lung carcinoid tumors, as well as tumors in the pancreas and the pituitary and parathyroid glands.","Your doctor will ask you questions about your medical history (that includes your family history) and examine you, listening to your lungs. These tests can help diagnose carcinoid tumors: Chest X-rays may show whether any tumors are in your lungs. Some may be too small or in locations that can’t be seen with standard X-rays. CT scans use X-rays and a computer to give a cross-section view of your lungs and can also show if any tumors have spread to other organs, such as your liver. Blood and urine tests may find substances that carcinoid tumors sometimes release. Serotonin or chromogranin-A in the blood may be a sign of a typical carcinoid tumor. The level of 5-HIAA, a byproduct of serotonin, can show up in your pee. A biopsy is a sample of tissue taken from your tumor and checked under a microscope. It can be done two ways. If you have a nonsurgical biopsy, you’ll probably be sedated. Your doctor may insert a bronchoscope, a type of thin, flexible camera, into your lungs to look at the tissue. If you have a surgical biopsy, you’ll have anesthesia and need to stay in the hospital. It will take longer to recover, too. Your doctor will have to make small surgical cuts in your chest to get the sample of tissue.","Your doctor can help you understand the pros and cons of all your treatment options and what’s likely to be best for you. Surgery is usually the first choice, depending on how healthy you are, where your tumors are in your lungs, whether they’re typical or atypical, and what stage they are. You may get chemotherapy or radiation therapy, sometimes after surgery. If your tumors can’t be removed with surgery or have spread or returned, your doctor may recommend targeted therapy, a special type of chemotherapy. The FDA approved everolimus (Afinitor) for this purpose in 2016. Certain drugs can ease symptoms caused by hormones that your tumors release and may slow their growth. A clinical trial may be an option if other treatments aren’t a good fit for you. In clinical trials, researchers study the safety and effectiveness of new treatments. Your doctor can help you look for a clinical trial that you may be eligible for. Make sure you know what’s involved, including the risks, benefits, and where you’ll go for treatment before you sign up.If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with carcinoid tumors in the lung, you may wonder what they are and how they’re different from other types of lung cancer. Carcinoid tumors are a rare type of lung cancer. Only 1% to 2% of lung cancers are carcinoid tumors. They usually grow slowly. They are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, meaning that they start in special cells, called neuroendocrine cells, that are found in the lungs and throughout the body."
Lung Nocardiosis,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-nocardiosis,"The signs can be different, depending on which type you have. Pulmonary nocardiosis is the most common, and its symptoms are a lot like ones you might have with pneumonia or tuberculosis: The most common signs of primary cutaneous nocardiosis are skin abscesses on your hands, chest, or rear end. These are bumps on or below the skin’s surface that are usually filled with a fluid (pus). You also might have a fever. If not treated, the infection can spread through your bloodstream to your brain or, more rarely, to your kidneys, intestines, or other organs. It can be very serious. Signs that the infection has spread to your brain include: If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor right away.","The signs can be different, depending on which type you have.

This might include tissue or mucus from your lungs or tissue from your skin.  If the infection is in your lungs, you might get a chest X-ray -- or a CT scan, which takes X-rays from several angles and puts them together to make a more detailed image.","Nocardiosis usually can be cured with antibiotics, but not all of them will work against the bacteria. Your doctor might need to run some lab tests to see which ones will work best for you. Then you might need to take them for 6 weeks up to a year, depending on how serious your infection is.  In some cases, you might need surgery to remove or drain abscesses in infected areas.Nocardiosis is a disease caused by bacteria found in soil or standing water. It starts in your lungs or skin, and can cause serious problems if it gets into your bloodstream and infects other parts of your body. Nocardiosis comes in two forms. You get the pulmonary (lung) version from breathing in the bacteria. The second type is primary cutaneous (skin). That’s when the bacteria gets into an open wound like a scratch. Between 500 and 1,000 people get it each year in the United States. Men are three times more likely to be infected by it than women -- middle-aged men working outdoors are at the highest risk. You also may have a greater chance of getting it if you have a weak immune system because of a condition like diabetes, HIV, or cancer, or if you’ve had a bone-marrow or organ transplant. If you’ve taken high doses of powerful steroids (drugs that help with inflammation), it also increases your chances."
Lyme Disease,https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/arthritis-lyme-disease,"There are three stages: About 10% of people treated for Lyme infection don’t shake the disease. They may go on to have three core symptoms: joint or muscle pain, fatigue, and short-term memory loss or confusion. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. It can be hard to diagnose because it has the same symptoms as other diseases. Plus, there isn't a blood test to confirm it. Experts aren’t sure why Lyme symptoms don’t always go away. One theory is that your body keeps fighting the infection even after the bacteria are gone, like an autoimmune disorder.","Symptoms can start anywhere from 3 to 30 days after the bite. They may look different depending on the stage of your infection. In some cases, you won’t notice any symptoms until months after the bite. Early symptoms include: All of those symptoms are also common in the flu. In most Lyme infections, one of the first symptoms you’ll notice is a rash. Without treatment, symptoms can get worse. They might include: What does the rash look like? Some Lyme rashes look like a bull's-eye with circles around the middle. But most are round, red, and at least 2 inches across.The rash slowly gets bigger over several days. It can grow to about 12 inches across. It may feel warm to the touch, but it’s usually not itchy or painful. It can show up on any part of your body.    How small are ticks? Ticks come in three sizes, depending on their life stage. They can be the size of a grain of sand, a poppy seed, or an apple seed.",,,"With early-stage Lyme disease, you’ll take antibiotics for about 10 days to 3 weeks. The most common ones are amoxicillin, cefuroxime, and doxycycline. The antibiotics will almost always cure your infection. If they don’t, you might get other antibiotics either by mouth or as a shot.If you don’t treat your Lyme infection, you might need oral antibiotics for symptoms like weakened face muscles and irregular heartbeat. You may need antibiotics if you have meningitis, inflammation in your brain and spinal cord, or more severe heart problems. If your Lyme is late stage, the doctor might give you antibiotics either by mouth or as a shot. If it causes arthritis, you’ll get arthritis treatment.

LAM is not cancer, but appears similar to other conditions in which benign tumors grow uncontrollably. LAM lung disease shares some features with a different condition called tuberous sclerosis.","Most people with LAM lung disease experience shortness of breath. Other symptoms include wheezing and cough, which may be bloody. Often, people with LAM develop a sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This occurs when one of the cysts near the lung's edge ruptures, allowing inhaled air to compress the lung. A pneumothorax usually causes pain and shortness of breath.

But doctors often recommend collecting a sample of lung tissue (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis. Lung biopsies can be collected in different ways: A physician (pathologist) then examines lung biopsy tissue, helping make the diagnosis of LAM lung disease with greater certainty.","The drug sirolimus (Rapamune) is the first drug approved to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The drug has been found to help improve the lung capacity in patients, allowing them to breathe easier. In addition, inhaled bronchodilators (albuterol, ipratropium) can help open the airways, reducing shortness of breath in some people. Patients with LAM lung disease should avoid smoking cigarettes as well as second hand smoke. Because hormones like estrogen seem to be involved in LAM lung disease, treatments that manipulate hormone levels could help some people with LAM. A number of hormone-related treatments have been tested in women with LAM lung disease: In clinical trials that tested these therapies, some women were helped, but others were not. People who experience pneumothorax generally must undergo procedures to reinflate the collapsed lung, and prevent its recurrence. If pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis progresses and becomes disabling, lung transplantation may be an option. Though it's a drastic treatment, most people undergoing lung transplant for LAM lung disease gain improved lung function and quality of life after surgery."

Malignant Mesothelioma,https://www.webmd.com/lung/mesothelioma-causes-and-symptoms,"The main risk factor for mesothelioma is working with asbestos. Asbestos is a group of minerals with thin microscopic fibers. Because these fibers are resistant to heat, fire, and chemicals and do not conduct electricity, asbestos has been mined and used widely in the construction, automotive, and other industries. If tiny asbestos fibers are released into the air, as they are in the manufacturing process, they can be inhaled or swallowed, leading to serious health problems. As many as 75% of mesothelioma cases can be linked to exposure to asbestos at work. There is also some evidence that family members and others living with asbestos workers have an increased risk of developing mesothelioma, and possibly other asbestos-related diseases.

However, mesothelioma has been reported in some individuals without any known exposure to asbestos. Other, uncommon, but possible causes include: Zeolites. These minerals are chemically related to asbestos.

These include: Blood tests. Blood levels of three substances -- fibulin-3, osteopontin, and soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRPs) -- are often higher in people with mesothelioma. Although these blood tests cannot confirm a diagnosis of mesothelioma -- more study is needed before they can be of reliable use in a clinical setting -- high levels of these substances make the disease more likely. Fluid and tissue sample tests. If you have a buildup of fluid in the body that may be related to mesothelioma, your doctor can remove a sample of the fluid by putting a needle through the skin into the area of fluid buildup. The fluid can then be examined under a microscope for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, further tests can tell if the cancer is mesothelioma.This test goes by different names, depending on where the fluid is: Even if your doctor does not find mesothelioma cells in fluid, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't have mesothelioma. Sometimes samples of actual tissue (biopsies) are needed to diagnose mesothelioma. Biopsies. There are ways to remove tissue to be examined for mesothelioma.

Three standard types of treatment are used: surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Treating mesothelioma often involves a combination of two or all three. Surgery. The main surgeries used in mesothelioma treatment are:Radiation therapy. This type of cancer treatment uses high-energy X-rays and other types of radiation to kill mesothelioma cells or keep them from growing. Radiation may be given externally or internally. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into the area near the mesothelioma. Chemotherapy. This uses drugs to stop the growth of cancerous mesothelioma cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Chemotherapy can be given by mouth, injected into a vein or muscle to enter the bloodstream and reach mesothelioma cells throughout the body, or it can be placed directly into the affected area of the body to mainly affect mesothelioma cells in that area. Sometimes, doctors use more than one chemotherapy drug. This is called combination chemotherapy."

X-rays provide information on the position of your teeth and roots and if any teeth have yet to come through the gums. Special cephalometrics or panoramic X-rays show the relationship of the teeth to the jaws and the jaws to the head. Your orthodontist may also want to take regular photographs of your face to further examine the relationship between the teeth, jaws, and head. Finally, impressions may be made of your teeth. This is done by having you bite down on a soft material that is later used to create an exact copy of your teeth.","Once a diagnosis is made, your orthodontist can decide the best treatment for your teeth or misaligned bite. For some people, a removable retainer (to stabilize the new position of teeth) will be all that's needed to correct the problem. In very rare cases, removal of one or more teeth may be required if overcrowding is the main problem. For most people, braces are necessary to correct the problem. In rare and extreme cases, such as an extreme overbite or underbite, an operation may be necessary. Learn more about correcting an overbite without braces.There are several reasons why some people's teeth grow in crooked, overlapping, or twisted. Some people's mouths are too small for their teeth, which crowds the teeth and causes them to shift. In other cases, a person's upper and lower jaws aren't the same size or are malformed, resulting in either an overbite, when there is excessive protrusion of the upper jaw, or an under bite, when the lower jaw protrudes forward causing the lower jaw and teeth to extend out beyond the upper teeth. Learn more about what causes an overbite, as well as how to tell the difference between an underbite vs overbite. Most often crooked teeth, overbites, and underbites are inherited traits just as the color of your eyes or size of your hands. Other causes of misaligned bites are early loss of baby or adult teeth; improper fit of dental restorations (for example, fillings or crowns); gingivitis (gum disease); undue pressure on the teeth and gums; misalignment of the jaw after an injury; tumors of the mouth or jaw; or common oral health problems in children such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond the age of three, or prolonged use of a bottle."

Someone may feel the same mood state (depressed or manic) several times before switching to the opposite mood. These episodes can happen over a period of weeks, months, and sometimes even years.How severe it gets differs from person to person and can also change over time, becoming more or less severe. Symptoms of mania (""the highs""): Excessive happiness, hopefulness, and excitement Sudden changes from being joyful to being irritable, angry, and hostile Restlessness Rapid speech and poor concentration Increased energy and less need for sleep Unusually high sex drive Making grand and unrealistic plans Showing poor judgment Drug and alcohol abuse Becoming more impulsive Less need for sleep Less of an appetite Larger sense of self-confidence and well-being Being easily distracted During depressive periods (""the lows""), a person with bipolar disorder may have: Sadness Loss of energy Feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness Not enjoying things they once liked Trouble concentrating Forgetfulness Talking slowly Less of a sex drive Inability to feel pleasure Uncontrollable crying Trouble making decisions Irritability Needing more sleep Insomnia Appetite changes that make you lose or gain weight Thoughts of death or suicide Attempting suicide  ","When someone develops bipolar disorder, it usually starts when they're in late adolescence or young adulthood. Rarely, it can happen earlier in childhood. Bipolar disorder can run in families. Men and women are equally likely to get it. Women are somewhat more likely than men to go through ""rapid cycling,"" which is having four or more distinct mood episodes within a year. Women also tend to spend more time depressed than men with bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder usually develops later in life for women, and they’re more likely to have bipolar disorder II and be affected by seasonal mood changes. A combination of medical and mental issues is also more common in women. Those medical issues can include thyroid disease, migraine, and anxiety disorders.  Some things that make you more likely to have bipolar disorder include: Having a family member with bipolar disorder Going through a time of high stress or trauma Drug or alcohol abuse Certain health conditions Many people with the condition abuse alcohol or other drugs when manic or depressed. People with bipolar disorder are more likely to have seasonal depression, co-existing anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.",,"Bipolar disorder can be treated. It's a long-term condition that needs ongoing care. People who have four or more mood episodes in a year, or who also have drug or alcohol problems, can have forms of the illness that are much harder to treat. Treatment can make a huge difference. With a combination of things -- good medical care, medication, talk therapy, lifestyle changes, and the support of friends and family -- you can feel better. Bipolar disorder -- or manic depression, as it is also still sometimes called -- has no known  cure. It is a chronic health condition that requires lifetime management.  Plenty of people with this condition do well; they have families and jobs and live normal lives. Medication Medication is the main treatment, usually involving the following:  Mood stabilizers, such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), lamotrigine (Lamictal), lithium, or valproate (Depakote)Antipsychotic drugs, such as cariprazine (Vraylar), lumateperone (Caplyta), lurasidone (Latuda), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiapine (Seroquel) Antidepressants  Antidepressant-antipsychotic drugs, a combination of an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer Anti-anxiety medications or sleep medicines, such as sedatives like benzodiazepinesIt can take a while to find the right combination for you. You may need to try a few things before you and your doctor figure out what works best. Once you do, it’s important to stay on your medication and talk with your doctor before stopping or changing anything. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should talk with their doctors about medications that are safe to take.  Psychotherapy, or ""talk therapy,"" is often recommended, too. There are several different types. Options can include: Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT).

But when it comes to treating chronic pain, no single technique is guaranteed to produce complete pain relief. Relief may be found by using a combination of treatment options.",,,,"Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or eating plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not methodologically strong.

Meralgia Paresthetica,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/meralgia-paresthetica,"Meralgia paresthetica is a condition that causes numbness, pain, or a burning feeling in your outer thigh. You might also hear it called Bernhardt-Roth syndrome. It happens when there’s too much pressure on or damage to one of the nerves in your leg, specifically the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (LFCN). In most cases, there are simple ways to treat the condition, such as wearing looser clothing. Some people with more severe meralgia paresthetica may need medication or surgery. With the right treatment and enough time to recover, you can ease your symptoms and feel better.","Usually, you’ll notice the warning signs of meralgia paresthetica only on one side of your body. You might feel: Your symptoms may be mild at first, but as the condition gets worse, you might feel sharper, shooting pain. It may go away and come back for no clear reason.","Nerves travel throughout your body, carrying messages to and from your brain. A certain set of nerves, called the sensory nerves, gather and send signals to your brain about your skin, muscles, and other tissues. If you have meralgia paresthetica, a large sensory nerve in your outer thigh doesn’t have enough room to pass through your hip bone or joints. This may be due to swelling, trauma, or increased pressure in this area. A lot of things can squeeze or damage the nerve, including: Your risk of getting the condition is higher if you:","Your doctor will give you a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and your medical history -- especially about any recent injuries or surgeries. The doctor will touch your leg to find the affected area. They will check for any neurological abnormalities of the lower leg. You may get certain medical tests: It can be hard to tell the difference between meralgia paresthetica and other back, hip, or groin conditions. Be patient as you work with your doctor to find the right diagnosis.","The goal of treatment is to ease the pressure on your nerve. The type of therapy you get depends on the cause of your condition. Lifestyle changes and home care For mild cases, your doctor may recommend: Physical therapy You may work with a physical therapist on stretching and strengthening exercises for your leg muscles or abs. They may also try phonophoresis, which uses ultrasound to help your body absorb a medication through your skin, or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which delivers electrical impulses through pads applied to your skin to block pain.Medications If your condition is more severe, you may need:"
Metastatic Melanoma,https://www.webmd.com/melanoma-skin-cancer/metastatic-melanoma,"Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. When it spreads to other places in your body, it's called metastatic, or advanced. You may also hear your doctor refer to it as stage IV melanoma. Melanoma often spreads to: Although in many cases metastatic melanoma can’t be cured, treatments and support can help you live longer and better. Doctors have therapies that have greatly increased survival rates. And researchers are working to find new medications that can do even more. Remember: You still have control over the decisions you make about your treatment and your life. It's important to have people you can talk to about your plans, your fears, and your feelings. So find support and learn about your treatment options. That will help you make the most of your life.","If your melanoma has spread to other areas, you may have:","In most cases, melanoma is caused by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. It damages the DNA of your skin cells, and they start to grow out of control.You can get the disease on parts of your body that don't get sunlight, though, like the palms of your hands and the retinas of your eyes. You're more likely to get melanoma if you have:","Before you have any tests, your doctor will want to know:If you haven’t already been diagnosed with melanoma, your doctor will do a skin exam. If they think you may have skin cancer, you'll need a biopsy to find out. You usually get one of three types: A doctor will look at the growth under a microscope to see how thick it is. Usually, a thicker tumor means there is a higher risk the cancer will spread.  If you've been diagnosed with melanoma, you may also have a blood test and an imaging test to see if it has spread to other areas. There are different types of imaging tests:","Although metastatic melanoma is not easy to treat, you do have options. Choosing what's right for you will depend on where and how big the cancer is, what your health is like, and what your wishes are. Since most cases of metastatic melanoma can't be cured, the goals of treatment are to: Treatment used to be mainly radiation and chemotherapy. Now there are newer drugs available that can work better, studies show. Your treatment may include: Surgery. Your doctor may remove tumors or lymph glands. Although surgery alone probably won't cure the cancer, it can help you live longer and have fewer symptoms. Your doctor will likely also use one or more other treatments. Radiation and chemotherapy. These can help some people, depending on the size and location of the cancer. Immunotherapy. These drugs boost your immune system so it can better attack the cancer. You get immunotherapy through an IV or a shot in high doses. It can have serious side effects, but it can also shrink metastatic melanomas and help some people live longer. These drugs include:Researchers are studying many other drugs that spur the immune system to fight melanoma. Targeted therapy. This kind of treatment aims to kill cancer cells without harming healthy ones. They may work for people who have certain changes in genes. Because these treatments target the tumors, they may cause fewer side effects than chemotherapy or radiation. Some drugs attack a gene called BRAF. About half the people who have melanoma have changes in this gene, which helps cancer cells grow. If you have a tumor with BRAF, these drugs may shrink it and extend your life. They include: Vemurafenib (Zelboraf) Other drugs block an enzyme called MEK. This enzyme is often overactive in some cancers. These drugs, working in combination with a BRAF inhibitor to attack cancer cells, seem to shrink tumors for a longer period of time:"
MG,https://www.webmd.com/brain/understanding-myasthenia-gravis-basics,"Myasthenia gravis is a chronic condition that causes muscles to tire and weaken easily. For example, if you have myasthenia gravis, you may notice that during a meal, your jaw muscles become tired and weak, interfering with your ability to chew food. After you have rested for a little while, the muscles may become strong again, allowing you to resume eating. This waxing-and-waning weakness of muscles, worsening with use and improving with rest, is a hallmark of this disease. There typically are periods when you may notice more symptoms (called an exacerbation), interspersed with periods when symptoms decrease or disappear (remission). Myasthenia gravis affecting multiple muscle groups throughout the body is called generalized myasthenia gravis. Other common muscle groups that are affected may make it difficult for you to chew, swallow, smile, shrug, lift your arm up, grip, rise to a stand, or walk up stairs. When the muscles needed for breathing are affected, a patient is said to be in myasthenic crisis. This is a life-threatening situation. Though anyone can get myasthenia gravis, those most likely to do so are women between ages 20 and 40 or men between ages 50 and 70. If a woman with myasthenia gravis gives birth, the baby may have some temporary, and potentially life-threatening, muscle weakness (neonatal myasthenia) because of antibodies that have transferred from the mother's bloodstream. Typically, during the baby's first weeks of life, the antibodies are cleared from the baby's circulation and the baby develops normal muscle tone and strength.","The disease most commonly affects muscles that control eye and eyelid movement, so the first symptoms you notice may be eyelid drooping and/or blurred or doubled vision. The majority will go on to have weakness in other muscle groups in 1 or 2 years. General symptoms of myasthenia gravis include: If the muscles you use to breathe get weak enough that you can’t control them, it’s called a myasthenic crisis. This is a medical emergency that may require a ventilator to help you breathe. Around 15% to 20% of people with myasthenia gravis have at least one myasthenic crisis. They can be caused by an infection, stress, surgery, or a reaction to medication.","Under normal conditions, nerves direct your muscles to work by sending a message through an area called a receptor. The chemical that delivers the message is called acetylcholine. When acetylcholine binds to a nerve receptor, your muscle knows to contract. In myasthenia gravis, your body attacks its acetylcholine receptors.Myasthenia gravis is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. In an autoimmune disease, some of the body's antibodies (special proteins in your body that are supposed to be programmed to fight foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi) mistake a part of your own body as foreign, resulting in its destruction. In the case of myasthenia gravis, antibodies block, attack or destroy the acetylcholine receptors needed for muscle contraction. No one knows exactly what causes the body to begin producing the antibodies that destroy acetylcholine receptors. In some cases, the process seems to be related to the thymus gland, which helps produce antibodies. About 15% of all myasthenia gravis patients are found to have a thymoma, a tumor of the thymus. Although most thymomas are benign (not cancerous), the thymus is usually removed (thymectomy) to prevent the potential spread of cancer. In fact, thymectomy seems to improve symptoms of myasthenia gravis in some patients, even if no tumor is present.","To see if you have myasthenia gravis, your doctor will start with a neurological exam. This includes a test of your: Then you’ll have tests to help look more closely at symptoms of myasthenia gravis. These include:","Your treatment will depend on your age, how severe your symptoms are, and how fast the condition is progressing. You might need one or several treatments together. Your doctor may recommend a medication such as: If you’re dealing with a sudden worsening of symptoms or will soon have surgery or other therapies, your doctor may recommend intravenous (IV) therapy. Choices for this include:If your myasthenia gravis is due to a tumor on your thymus gland, you may need surgery to remove the whole gland (thymectomy). Even if you don’t have a tumor, taking your thymus out may help ease your symptoms. It may take years to see benefits from a thymectomy. You may need open surgery to remove your thymus. A surgeon opens your breastbone to get to your thymus and take it out. Another option that may work is minimally invasive surgery. There are two options:"

Micropolygyria with Muscular Dystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve:"
Middle Ear Infection,https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/ear-infection/understanding-otitis-media-basics,"The middle ear is a small space behind the ear drum that is supposed to be well ventilated by air that normally passes up from behind the nose, through the Eustachian tube, keeping the middle ear clean and dry. When there is not enough fresh air ventilating the middle ear, such as when the Eustachian tube is clogged or blocked, the area becomes damp, stagnant, and warm, a perfect breeding ground for germs. In children and infants, the Eustachian tube is often too soft or immature and has a harder time staying open. Allergies, post nasal drainage, sinus infections, common cold viruses and adenoid problems can all interfere with the Eustachian tube’s ability to let air pass into the middle ear. When the doctor looks at the eardrum, he or she will see that it is red, often bulging, and be able to make the diagnosis of an ear infection.  For children, the most common trigger of an ear infection is an upper respiratory viral infection, such as a cold or the flu. These disorders can make the Eustachian tube so swollen that air can no longer flow into the middle ear. Allergies -- to pollen, dust, animal dander, or food -- can produce the same effect as a cold or flu, as can smoke, fumes, and other environmental toxins. Bacteria can cause an ear infection directly, but usually these organisms come on the heels of a viral infection or an allergic reaction, quickly finding their way into the warm, moist environment of the middle ear. Invading bacteria can wreak major havoc, turning inflammation into infection and provoking fevers. Among the bacteria most often found in infected middle ears are the same varieties responsible for many cases of sinusitis, pneumonia, and other respiratory infections. According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (ear, nose, and throat physicians), the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine is very effective against several strains of the most common bacteria that cause ear infections. This vaccine is routinely given to infants and toddlers to prevent meningitis, pneumonia, and blood infections. Your child’s doctor should advise you on the use of this vaccine, which may help to prevent at least some ear infections.Ear infections occur in various patterns. A single, isolated case is called an acute ear infection (acute otitis media). If the condition clears up but comes back as many as three times in a 6-month period (or four times in a single year), the person is said to have recurrent ear infections (recurrent acute otitis media). This usually indicates the Eustachian tube isn't working well. A fluid buildup in the middle ear without infection is termed otitis media with effusion, a condition where fluid stays in the ear because it is not well ventilated, but germs have not started to grow. In recent years, scientists have identified the characteristics of people most likely to suffer recurrent middle ear infections:  ",,"The middle ear is a small space behind the ear drum that is supposed to be well ventilated by air that normally passes up from behind the nose, through the Eustachian tube, keeping the middle ear clean and dry.

And remember that everyone heals at a different pace and in different ways. ","Most miscarriages happen when the unborn baby has fatal genetic problems. Usually, these problems are not related to the mother. Other problems that can increase the risk of miscarriage include: A woman has a higher risk of miscarriage if they: Cervical insufficiency. A miscarriage sometimes happens when the mother has a weakness of the cervix. Doctors call this a cervical insufficiency. It means the cervix can’t hold the pregnancy. This type of miscarriage usually happens in the second trimester. There are usually few symptoms before a miscarriage caused by cervical insufficiency. You may feel sudden pressure, your water might break, and tissue from the baby and placenta could leave your body without much pain. Doctors usually treat an insufficient cervix with a ""circling"" stitch in the next pregnancy, usually around 12 weeks. The stitch holds your cervix closed until the doctor removes it around the time of delivery. If you never had a miscarriage but your doctor finds that you have cervical insufficiency they might add the stitch to prevent a miscarriage.","To check whether you've had a miscarriage, your doctor will do:","If the miscarriage is complete and your uterus is empty, you probably won’t need further treatment. Sometimes all the tissue doesn’t come out. If that happens, your doctor might do a dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure. They’ll dilate your cervix and gently remove any remaining tissue. There are also medications you can take that cause any tissue left in your uterus to leave your body. This may be a better option if you want to avoid surgery.If it’s later in the pregnancy and the fetus has died in the womb, the doctor will induce labor and delivery. When the bleeding stops, you should be able to go back to your normal activities. If your cervix dilated on its own but you’re still pregnant, you could have a condition known as incompetent cervix. Your doctor might do a procedure to close it called cerclage. If your blood type is Rh negative, the doctor may give you a blood product called Rh immune globulin (Rhogam). This prevents you from developing antibodies that could harm your baby or any future pregnancies. You may get blood tests, genetic tests, or medication if you’ve had more than two miscarriages in a row (recurrent miscarriage). To diagnose this condition, your doctor might use tests like: If you've had two miscarriages in a row, use a form of birth control and talk to your doctor about tests to find the cause"
Misophonia,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/what-is-misophonia,"Misophonia is a disorder in which certain sounds trigger emotional or physiological responses that some might perceive as unreasonable given the circumstance. Those who have misophonia might describe it as when a sound “drives you crazy.” Their reactions can range from anger and annoyance to panic and the need to flee. The disorder is sometimes called selective sound sensitivity syndrome. Individuals with misophonia often report they are triggered by oral sounds  -- the noise someone makes when they eat, breathe, or even chew. Other adverse sounds include keyboard or finger tapping or the sound of windshield wipers. Sometimes a small repetitive motion is the cause -- someone fidgets, jostles you, or wiggles their foot. Similarly, people with misophonia also say they often react to the visual stimuli that accompanies sounds, and may also respond intensely to repetitive motions. Researchers believe that those with misophonia may already have issues with how their brains filter sounds and that one of the features of “misophonic sounds” may be their repetitive noise. That repetition then exacerbates the other auditory processing problems.The disorder appears to range from mild to severe. Individuals report a range of physiologic and emotional responses, with accompanying cognitions. If you have a mild reaction, you might feel: If your response is more severe, the sound in question might cause: The disorder can put a cramp in your social life. Those with misophonia have been known to develop anticipatory anxiety when going into situations where trigger sounds may be present. You might avoid restaurants or eat separately from your spouse, family, or roommates. Over time, you may also respond to visual triggers, too. Seeing something that you know may create the offending sound may elicit a response.",,,,"The condition does affect daily life, but you can learn to manage it. Treatment often involves a multidisciplinary approach combining sound therapy by audiologists and supportive counseling in which coping strategies are emphasized. You might try a device like a hearing aid that creates a sound in your ear similar to a waterfall. The noise distracts you from triggers and reduces reactions. Other treatments include talk therapy. Your lifestyle also plays a role. Get regular exercise, plenty of sleep, and manage your stress. You can also wear ear plugs and headsets to tune out sounds. Set up quiet areas or safe spots in your home where no one will make the noises that bother you. And find support. The Misophonia Association is based in Oregon and California, and holds a yearly convention for suffers. The International Misophonia Research Network Misophonia-Research.com is a resource for doctors and researchers interested in learning more about misophonia. Misophonia International.com  offers free resources, such as handouts for parents, and webinars in association with Duke University for those in the U.S., Canada and U.K.Finally for those in the U.K. who are looking for support and research reports, try www.allergictosound.com You can also find online and social media groups where people share coping strategies.Do certain daily sounds trigger an over-the-top emotional reaction, but yet don’t seem to bother anyone else?

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hypothyroidism are two common causes of irregular periods in women. In general, the goal of treatment is to restore the balance of hormones in the body. If you have PCOS, your doctor may recommend birth control pills or other hormones to trigger a period. If you have hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), you may need to take thyroid hormones. Other things that may help include: Changing birth control. If you have irregular periods after 3 months of hormonal birth control, your doctor may recommend another type of birth control. Some women develop irregular periods when using Nexplanon, Depo-Provera, or an IUD.Lifestyle changes. Some women have changes in their period because they exercise too much. You may need to make your workouts less intense, or exercise less often. If stress is the problem, learning how to manage your stress -- and possibly also talking with a counselor -- may be helpful."
Mitchell Disease,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/burning-feet-causes-treatments,"Most often, neuropathy is the cause of burning feet.

Mitral Valve Regurgitation,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/what-is-mitral-valve-regurgitation,"Before you understand the details of how blood can flow the wrong way in one part of your heart, you need to know how things should work. The heart has four chambers: the left and right atrium on top and, below them, the left and right ventricles.As your heart beats, it draws blood from the body into the right atrium. This chamber sends it down to the right ventricle. From there, your blood is pumped to the lungs to pick up oxygen. When that oxygen-rich blood goes back to the heart, the left atrium takes it in and passes it down to the left ventricle. That chamber contracts, or squeezes, to send it to your body. You have a passageway between the left atrium and the left ventricle. That is the mitral valve.","Many people with only mild regurgitation won’t notice any symptoms. But if the condition worsens, you might have:","The most common reason this happens is because the mitral valve is damaged. This can be either from birth or because of a heart attack, which can weaken the tissue around it. You might hear a doctor say a valve is “prolapsed” if it doesn’t close up the way it should. Other possible causes:","Doctors usually find a problem with your heart valve by sound. If blood is leaking back into your left atrium, it will produce a murmur or a whooshing sound. Your doctor can hear that through a stethoscope. A common follow-up test is called an echocardiogram. This uses sound waves to make a picture of your beating heart, similar to the ultrasound tests given to pregnant women. Your doctor might also want to get a CT or MRI scan of your chest to help figure out what’s going on. These are just two more ways to get a visual picture of your insides.","If you have a really mild case, you might need no treatments at all. Your doctor will still want to keep a watchful eye on you with regular checkups. Medications can’t actually fix a valve problem, but they can target other things that make regurgitation worse. Drugs called diuretics (or “water pills”) can lessen fluid buildups. Blood thinners can help prevent clots if you have atrial fibrillation. You can take something if you have high blood pressure, which makes regurgitation worse. In more severe cases, you might need an operation."
Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD),https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/connective-tissue-disease,"Some connective tissue diseases -- often called heritable disorders of connective tissue (HDCTs) -- are the result of changes in certain genes. Many of these are quite rare. Following are some of the more common ones. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Actually a group of more than 10 disorders, EDS is characterized by over-flexible joints, stretchy skin, and abnormal growth of scar tissue. Symptoms can range from mild to disabling. Depending on the specific form of EDS, other symptoms may include:Epidermolysis bullosa (EB). People with EB have skin that is so fragile that it tears or blisters as a result of a minor bump, stumble, or even friction from clothing. Some forms of EB may involve the digestive tract, the respiratory tract, the muscles, or the bladder. Caused by defects of several proteins in the skin, EB is usually evident at birth. Marfan syndrome. Marfan syndrome affects the bones, ligaments, eyes, heart, and blood vessels. People with Marfan syndrome tend to be tall and have extremely long bones and thin ""spider-like"" fingers and toes. Other problems may include eye problems due to abnormal placement of the eye lens and enlargement of the aorta (the largest artery in the body), which can lead to a fatal rupture. Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene that regulates the structure of a protein called fibrillin-1. Osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta is a condition of brittle bones, low muscle mass, and lax joints and ligaments. There are several types of this condition. Specific symptoms depend on the specific type and may include: The disease occurs when a mutation in two genes responsible for type 1 collagen reduces the amount or quality of the protein. Type 1 collagen is important to the structure of bone and skin.",,,,
Mixed Hepatic Porphyria,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/porphyria-symptoms-causes-treatment,"Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause nerve or skin problems.

The most commonly affected areas include the face and the back of the: You may get symptoms on your skin such as:  ","No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn't have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria. These triggers can be things like: Episodes of acute porphyria, which rarely happen before puberty, can be set off by taking some kinds of drugs, including: Other things that might trigger acute porphyria are:  ","Doctors sometimes find it tricky to diagnose porphyria because the symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. If your doctor thinks you have it, they may order blood, urine, and stool tests to get a diagnosis. The best time for you to do these tests is when you have an outbreak of symptoms or around that time.Sometimes you'll get multiple tests to help your doctor figure out which specific type of porphyria you have. Your doctor may also suggest you get a genetic test. Since porphyria often runs in families, your doctor may recommend that others in your family get this test as well. Questions for your doctor  ","When you have an outbreak of acute porphyria symptoms, you may need to stay in the hospital. You'll get medicine for pain, nausea, and vomiting. Your doctor may prescribe givosiran (Givlaari), which helps reduce the toxins linked to the attacks.

Molar Pregnancy,https://www.webmd.com/baby/what-is-molar-pregnancy,"It’s due to problems with the fertilized egg. Normal human cells contain 23 pairs of chromosomes -- one set from the mother and the other from the father. These structures carry information that tells the body’s cells what to do. In a molar pregnancy, there’s an extra set of chromosomes that comes from the father. When this happens, a fertilized egg can’t survive. It usually dies a few weeks into the pregnancy.","At first, your pregnancy might seem normal. But over time, you may start to notice the following: Call your doctor if you have these or any other unusual symptoms during pregnancy.","In the United States, molar pregnancy occurs in about 1 out of every 1,000 pregnancies. Certain things may increase the chances it will happen:",,"Your doctor may use a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C). This is often the treatment for pregnancy loss due to any reason. During this procedure, your doctor opens your cervix with special tools and removes the tissue from your uterus. This is the best option for you if you want to get pregnant again. After a D&C, your doctor may do blood tests several times over the next few months. They will look to see whether your HCG levels are getting back to normal. If you don’t want to get pregnant again, then you may consider a total hysterectomy. That’s surgery to remove your uterus.In rare cases, a complete molar pregnancy can lead to a condition called persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). This means the abnormal tissue grows outside your uterus and into the layer of muscle below it. A D&C won’t work because it only removes tissue within the uterus. You may need to have a hysterectomy or receive chemotherapy (“chemo”) to treat persistent GTD. A molar pregnancy can also lead to a cancerous form of GTD called choriocarcinoma. You’ll need to have chemo to treat it. After a molar pregnancy, your doctor might recommend that you don’t conceive for 1 year. Pregnancy increases HCG levels, so it would be hard for them to know whether the rise in hormones is due to that, abnormal tissue that’s still in your body, or choriocarcinoma.A positive pregnancy test is often followed by the joy of a newborn baby 9 months later. But there are times when a pregnancy ends in a loss. A molar pregnancy is one of those. During a healthy pregnancy, the placenta grows inside your uterus. It nourishes your baby through the umbilical cord. With a molar pregnancy, tissue in the uterus becomes an abnormal mass or tumor instead of a placenta. There are two types of molar pregnancy -- partial and complete. A partial one is when both the placenta and embryo (fertilized egg) are abnormal. In a complete molar pregnancy, there’s an abnormal placenta, but no embryo."

The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.","Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.","Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy. A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism. When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.X chromosome abnormalities. Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material. In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.","If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up.

It causes droopy eyelids, narrowing of the opening between the eyelids, reduced pupil size, and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.","You get this condition when something blocks the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which protects your spinal cord and brain. It enters the central canal of the spinal cord and can cause a cyst to form. With syringomyelia, there are two main reasons this fluid can get blocked or rerouted: a birth defect or trauma.Congenital syringomyelia, also called communicating syringomyelia, usually happens when there’s a problem with the baby’s brain development during pregnancy. A defect that doctors call a “Chiari I malformation” causes the lower part of the baby’s brain to push downward into their spinal canal. This blocks the normal flow of fluid between the spine and the brain, and a cyst forms. But not everyone with a Chiari I malformation gets this disorder. Symptoms usually show up between ages 25 and 40. Acquiredsyringomyelia, also called primary spinal or noncommunicating syringomyelia, is when a cyst forms in a damaged part of the spinal cord. It may happen when there is: Sometimes, it happens for reasons doctors don’t understand. They call this “idiopathic syringomyelia.”","Doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine to see if you have syringomyelia. The MRI can show a cyst or other condition. Sometimes, doctors discover you have this condition when doing an MRI for another health reason. You might also have a kind of X-ray procedure called a CT scan of your spine.","What kind of treatment you get for syringomyelia depends on whether you have symptoms, and how serious they are. Monitoring: You probably won’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms or if they’ve mild. But you should have regular checkups to watch for cyst growth and changes in signs and symptoms. The doctor may tell you to avoid activities like heavy lifting that involve straining. They might also prescribe medicine for pain or refer you to physical therapy. Surgery: If your symptoms cause problems, you may need surgery to restore the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. The type of surgery you’ll have depends on what caused your syringomyelia. For example, if the problem is due to a Chiari I malformation, your doctor might do a procedure called posterior fossa decompression. They’ll remove the bone at the back of your skull and spine. It creates more space for your brainstem and cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls your movements and balance. Talk to the doctor about the risks and benefits of surgery."

It's tougher to treat than most strains of staphylococcus aureus – or staph – because it's resistant to some commonly used antibiotics. Though most MRSA infections aren't serious, some can be life-threatening. Many public health experts are alarmed by the spread of tough strains of MRSA. It’s sometimes called a ""superbug"" because it's hard to treat.  ","The symptoms of MRSA infection depend on where you've been infected. MRSA most often appears as a skin infection, like a boil or abscess. It also might infect a surgical wound. In either case, the area would be: Many people who have a staph skin infection often mistake it for a spider bite. If staph infects the lungs and causes pneumonia, you will have: MRSA can cause many other symptoms because once it gets into your bloodstream, it can settle anywhere. MRSA can cause an abscess (inflamed tissue with pus inside) in your spleen, kidney, or spine. It can cause endocarditis (heart valve infections), osteomyelitis (bone infections),  joint infections, mastitis (infection in the breast), and infections of implanted prosthetic devices (like those used in a knee replacement, for instance). Unlike most MRSA skin infections, which can be treated in the doctor's office, these more serious infections will land you in the hospital. You’ll get antibiotics in an IV to help kill the infection. Very rarely, staph can result in necrotizing fasciitis, or ""flesh-eating"" bacterial infections. These are serious skin infections that spread very quickly. While frightening, very few necrotizing fasciitis cases have been reported.","Garden-variety staph are common bacteria that can live in our bodies. Plenty of healthy people carry staph without being infected by it. In fact, one-third of everybody has staph bacteria in their noses. But staph can be a problem if it manages to get into the body, often through a cut. Staph is one of the most common causes of skin infections in the U.S. Usually, these are minor and don't need special treatment. Less often, staph can cause serious problems like infected wounds or pneumonia.   Staph can usually be treated with antibiotics. But over the decades, some strains of staph, like MRSA, have become resistant to antibiotics that once destroyed them. MRSA was discovered in 1961. It's now resistant to amoxicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, penicillin, and other common antibiotics known as cephalosporins. While some antibiotics still work, MRSA is constantly adapting.

MSA,https://www.webmd.com/parkinsons-disease/parkinsons-plus-syndromes,"Parkinson’s plus syndromes are more serious and harder to treat than “classic” Parkinson’s disease. The four main types are: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) This is the most common Parkinson’s plus syndrome. It causes some of the same issues with movement and your muscles as Parkinson’s disease, like stiffness and problems with walking or balance, but it doesn’t usually make your limbs shake. It also can make it harder to move your eyes -- it starts in the part of your brain that controls your eye muscles. Looking down can be especially hard. It can cause mood changes, affect your ability to think of words, and make it hard to swallow as well.Dementia With Lewy Bodies This is the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease. Lewy bodies are clumps of protein that build up in your nerve cells. When that happens, it affects your ability to think clearly, speak, and remember things. It can make you confused and cause hallucinations (when you see things that aren’t there). The symptoms get worse over time. Multiple System Atrophy This affects what’s known as your autonomic nervous system, which controls things like your blood pressure and digestive system. Symptoms can include things like fainting, losing control of your bladder, and constipation. It also causes more typical Parkinson’s symptoms, like shaking, stiffness, and problems with balance or speech.",,,"Parkinson’s plus syndromes can look a lot like other conditions that affect your nervous system, so it can sometimes take a while to find out for sure what’s going on. If your doctor thinks you might have Parkinson’s or a Parkinson’s plus syndrome, they’ll recommend that you see a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in problems with the nervous system. Your neurologist will examine you and see how you move and follow directions. They then might suggest blood tests and a brain scan to rule out other conditions. If those don’t show a reason for your symptoms, they may ask you to try a medication called carbidopa-levodopa. Your brain can turn that into dopamine. If your symptoms get better, that may be enough for your doctor to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. If it doesn’t help much or at all, or it helps for a while then stops working, that can be a sign of a Parkinson’s plus syndrome. Other things that can point to a Parkinson’s plus syndrome rather than the classic form include:","Doctors don’t know exactly what causes any of the Parkinson’s plus syndromes, and there’s no cure for them. Treating them usually is about managing the symptoms. That can include the following:Parkinson’s plus syndromes, also called “atypical Parkinson’s,” are illnesses that attack your brain and nerve cells. As the name suggests, they’re linked to Parkinson’s disease and cause a lot of the same symptoms, but they can bring on other problems as well. Your brain makes a chemical called dopamine that helps control your movement. “Parkinsonism” is the word doctors use to describe several conditions that can happen if you don’t make enough of it. Parkinson’s disease is by far the most common of these, but about 15% of people who have a problem making dopamine will have one of the Parkinson’s plus syndromes."
MSL,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-is-a-lipoma,"A lipoma is a lump of fat that grows in your body’s soft tissues. Though it’s classified as a tumor, it’s usually harmless. It’s the most common tumor to form beneath your skin. About 1 person out of every 1,000 will get one at some point. You most often find them in your upper body, arms, or thighs.","They usually appear as small, soft lumps. They’re typically less than 2 inches wide. You could have more than one. When you press on the lipoma, it may feel doughy. It will move easily with finger pressure. They don’t normally hurt, but they can cause pain if they bump against nearby nerves or have blood vessels running through them.","It isn’t clear what causes them. Middle-aged men and women tend to get them more. They also run in families. Lipomas often show up after an injury, though doctors don’t know whether that’s what makes them form. Inherited conditions can bring them on. Some people who have a rare condition known as Madelung’s disease can get them. This most often affects men of Mediterranean ancestry who have alcohol use disorder.","Lipomas can usually be diagnosed with a physical exam. But you may need a biopsy, in which a small piece of the tissue is removed and looked at under a microscope, to confirm the diagnosis. Tests like X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs can also give a clearer picture.","Since lipomas aren’t harmful, doctors often leave them alone. You may need to keep an eye on it between visits.If one hurts or you don’t like the way it looks, you might want to have it removed. Your doctor can take it out surgically with a small cut. You’ll get a shot of medication to numb the area so it won’t hurt. You should be able to go home after it’s done. You may have to go back within a couple of weeks to get a few stitches taken out.

A dad with Hunter syndrome will pass the problem gene to their daughter, but the daughter won't get the disease unless they get the gene from their mom, too. It's possible -- but very, very unlikely -- that someone could develop Hunter syndrome even though no one in their family going back has had it.","Doctors often have to rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor may ask: If the doctors can't find another explanation for your son's symptoms, they'll test for Hunter syndrome by checking for: After doctors are sure it's Hunter syndrome, it's a good idea to let extended family members know about the gene problem, too.

Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I,https://www.webmd.com/children/mucopolysaccharidosis-i-mps-i,"MPS I stands for mucopolysaccharidosis type I. It starts in childhood. You can't ""catch"" it -- it comes from your genes. People with MPS I can't make a specific protein called alpha-L iduronidase, which is needed to break down sugars. These sugars build up in cells and cause damage throughout the body. People who have this disease can have problems with how their bodies grow and work, as well as trouble with thinking and learning. They might look different, too. Many people with milder MPS I can go to school and eventually work and have families. And even for people with more severe MPS I, there are treatments to help ease their symptoms and slow down the disease.  Because it affects people in so many different ways, doctors used to separate MPS I into groups: Hurler, Hurler-Scheie, and Scheie syndromes. Now they talk about a range between two forms:","Many babies with MPS I don't show any signs of the disease at first. For those with less severe MPS I, symptoms show up later in childhood. People with this form, attenuated MPS I, probably can make a tiny bit of the protein, which is why their symptoms are milder and the disease moves very slowly. Children who have the severe form usually start to have symptoms while they're still infants. They're often big when they're born and grow quickly for a year, but then stop by the time they're 3. They might never grow taller than 4 feet. They also tend to look similar:MPS I can show up in a lot of different ways:","MPS I is passed down through families. But you get it only when both parents give you a broken gene. If you get one normal gene and one ""bad"" gene, you won't have symptoms of MPS I. You could pass the gene to your children, though.","Because it's a rare disease, doctors rule out other medical conditions first. Your doctor might ask: If the doctors can't find another explanation for your child's symptoms, they'll test for MPS I by checking for:After doctors are sure it's MPS I, it's a good idea to let your extended family know about the gene problem, too. If you are pregnant, know you are a carrier of the gene, and already have a child with MPS I, you can find out whether the baby you're carrrying is affected. Talk to your doctor about testing. ","Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) uses a drug called laronidase (Aldurazyme), a man-made version of the missing protein. It has changed the outlook for many kids with MPS I. It can relieve most symptoms and slow the progress of the disease, although it doesn't help treat symptoms from the brain, like problems with thinking or learning.Another option may be a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), in which doctors put new cells into your child's body that might make the protein their body is missing. These cells often come from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood. When children get a transplant before they're 2 years old, they might be able to learn better. But HSCT can't fix bone or eye problems. Work with a doctor who specializes in lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs. Depending on what symptoms your child has, you might need to see other specialists, too. Often they'll include a cardiologist, who focuses on the heart, and an eye doctor."

Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/autoimmune-blistering-disorders,"Autoimmune blistering disorders (also called autoimmune blistering diseases or autoimmune bullous disorders) are a group of rare skin diseases. They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth, nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form. Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications.","The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders  cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore.","When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders. Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters. Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as: Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include: Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them.","You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed. You might get one or more of these tests:Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including:  ","Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs: For more serious cases, your treatments might include: Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection:  "
Mud Fever,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-leptospirosis,"You usually start showing signs of leptospirosis within 2 weeks, though in some cases, symptoms may not show up for a month or not at all.

Other typical symptoms include:Many of these symptoms are similar to other diseases, including the flu and meningitis, so it’s important to get tested. To check for leptospirosis, your doctor does a simple blood test and examines the blood for antibodies. These are organisms your body produces to fight the bacteria. If you have had the disease in your system before, the blood test may give a false positive (or show antibodies from the previous infection). So your doctor will likely do a second test about a week later to make sure the results are correct. Your doctor could order a DNA test.

You’re more likely to be exposed to it if you have one of these jobs: Also, if you raft, swim, or camp near affected lakes and rivers, you could get the disease. Leptospirosis is more often found in warm climates. And although the bacteria lives all over the world, it’s especially common in Australia, Africa, Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.",,"Leptospirosis can be treated with antibiotics, including penicillin and doxycycline. Your doctor may also recommend ibuprofen for fever and muscle pain.The disease should run its course in about a week. But, you may have to go to the hospital if your infection is more severe. Symptoms may include kidney failure, meningitis, and lung problems. You may need to have antibiotics injected into your body, and in very serious cases, the infection could damage your organs. Treatment in cases of complications can vary. For example, the disease can spread through your body (systemic inflammatory syndrome) and cause internal bleeding and inflame your pancreas or gallbladder. You or those around you might notice changes in your speech or behavior after the spread of this infection. It also could inflame the heart muscle (myocarditis), leading to symptoms of heart failure including blockages and an irregular heartbeat (dysrhythmia). Your doctor will assess your other symptoms, overall health, health history, age, and other factors before deciding how to treat these complications."

Multiple Endocrine Deficiency Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/endocrine-system-disorders,"Each gland of the endocrine system releases specific hormones into your bloodstream. These hormones travel through your blood to other cells and help control or coordinate many body processes. Endocrine glands include: Even the slightest hiccup with the function of one or more of these glands can throw off the delicate balance of hormones in your body and lead to an endocrine disorder, or endocrine disease.",,"Endocrine disorders are typically grouped into two categories:The endocrine's feedback system helps control the balance of hormones in the bloodstream. If your body has too much or too little of a certain hormone, the feedback system signals the proper gland or glands to correct the problem. A hormone imbalance may occur if this feedback system has trouble keeping the right level of hormones in the bloodstream, or if your body doesn't clear them out of the bloodstream properly. Increased or decreased levels of endocrine hormone may be caused by: Most endocrine tumors and nodules (lumps) are noncancerous. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body. However, a tumor or nodule on the gland may interfere with the gland's hormone production.","If you have an endocrine disorder, your doctor may refer you to a specialist called an endocrinologist. An endocrinologist is specially trained in problems with the endocrine system.The symptoms of an endocrine disorder vary widely and depend on the specific gland involved. However, most people with endocrine disease complain of fatigue and weakness. Blood and urine tests to check your hormone levels can help your doctors determine if you have an endocrine disorder. Imaging tests may be done to help locate or pinpoint a nodule or tumor. Treatment of endocrine disorders can be complicated, as a change in one hormone level can throw off another. Your doctor or specialist may order routine blood work to check for problems or to determine if your medication or treatment plan needs to be adjusted.The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce and release hormones that help control many important body functions, including the body's ability to change calories into energy that powers cells and organs. The endocrine system influences how your heart beats, how your bones and tissues grow, even your ability to make a baby. It plays a vital role in whether or not you develop diabetes, thyroid disease, growth disorders, sexual dysfunction, and a host of other hormone-related disorders.",

After your test results come in, your doctor may want to do a bone marrow biopsy. They'll put a needle into a bone, usually in your hip, and take a sample of marrow to check the number of plasma cells in it. You might get imaging tests. X-rays can show spots of bone damaged by multiple myeloma. You may also need a CT scan, MRI, or PET scan.","Doctors grade multiple myeloma cases as high, intermediate, or standard risk, based on genes in the tumors. If you don't have symptoms, your doctor may choose to watch you closely rather than start treatment right away. If you have symptoms, your doctor will work with you to come up with a treatment plan.

Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency,https://www.webmd.com/brain/leukodystrophy-types,"The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly. But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought.

Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/munchausen-by-proxy,"In general, MSP is a very difficult disorder to treat and often requires years of therapy and support. In addition, MSP is considered a form of child abuse, which is a criminal offense.","Certain characteristics are common in a person with MSP, including: Other possible warning signs of MSP include:","The exact cause of MSP is not known, but researchers are looking at the roles of biological and psychological factors in its development. Some theories suggest that a history of abuse or neglect as a child, or the early loss of a parent may be factors in its development. Some evidence suggests that major stress, such as marital problems, can trigger MSP.",,"The first concern in MSP is to ensure the safety and protection of any real or potential victims. This may require that the child be placed in the care of another. In fact, managing a case involving MSP often requires a team that includes a social worker, foster care organizations, and law enforcement, as well as doctors. Successful treatment of people with MSP is difficult because those with the disorder often deny there is a problem. In addition, treatment success is dependent on the person telling the truth, and people with MSP tend to be such accomplished liars that they begin to have trouble telling fact from fiction. Psychotherapy (a type of counseling) generally focuses on changing the thinking and behavior of the individual with the disorder (cognitive-behavioral therapy). The goal of therapy for MSP is to help the person identify the thoughts and feelings that are contributing to the behavior, and to learn to form relationships that are not associated with being ill."
Murk Jansen Metaphyseal Chondrodysplasia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-chondrodysplasia,"Chondrodysplasias are genetic, which means they happen because of problems in genes. A child might inherit these gene flaws from parents. That’s the case with RCDP1. Achondroplasia usually happens due to a mutation in a certain gene, which a child could inherit. But more often, it happens randomly.","Beyond a person’s physical appearance -- such as short stature and a large head -- symptoms depend on what type of chondrodysplasia someone has. Some may have mental disabilities because of problems with brain development. But others do not. With other forms of chondrodysplasia, symptoms can include rough and scaly skin, a cleft palate, and deformities of the spinal cord. Some children develop cataracts, causing poor vision.","Chondrodysplasias are genetic, which means they happen because of problems in genes. A child might inherit these gene flaws from parents. That’s the case with RCDP1. Achondroplasia usually happens due to a mutation in a certain gene, which a child could inherit. But more often, it happens randomly.","Usually, a doctor would notice chondrodysplasia when a baby is born. The hallmarks of the condition, such as short limbs and a large head, are easy to spot. X-rays could show that the bones in the child’s arms and legs are unusually short in length and broad in width. A number of measurements of the bones in X-ray images will show they are abnormal in size. Doctors can usually also diagnose achondroplasia using ultrasound while the baby is still in the womb. There is also a genetic test that can confirm the diagnosis.","Your child’s treatment will depend upon what type of chondrodysplasia they have. Most treatments don't increase your child’s height, but they could relieve other problems. If your baby has achondroplasia and is healthy, you might only need to keep in touch with your pediatrician to make sure your child is doing well and address any complications along the way. If your child has a severe form, you’ll work with a number of specialists, from physical therapists to nutritionists, and a lot of that care may happen at a hospital. In some rare cases, growth hormones have helped with bone development in people with chondrodysplasia, but it’s not a guaranteed treatment. Growth hormones don’t cure achondroplasia, and in many cases patients do not respond to any form of drugs. Some people with dwarfism may choose to have extended limb lengthening. This surgery is controversial because there are risks and it can be painful. Many times, the child only gains a few inches of height. Surgeons re-cut the limbs to “stretch” the bones, and braces hold the bones in place. A successful treatment may take several surgeries. Because the procedures can be physically and emotionally stressful, doctors recommend holding off on the surgery until the person is old enough to decide for themselves."
Muscular Dystrophies,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-muscular-dystrophy,"Muscular dystrophy is a group of diseases that make muscles weaker and less flexible over time. It is caused by a problem in the genes that control how the body keeps muscles healthy. For some people, the disease starts early in childhood. Others don’t have any symptoms until they are teenagers or middle-aged adults. How muscular dystrophy affects you or your child depends on the kind. Most people’s condition will get worse over time, and some people may lose the ability to walk, talk, or care for themselves. But that doesn’t happen to everyone. Other people can live for many years with mild symptoms. There are more than 30 kinds of muscular dystrophy, and each is different based on: People usually get one of nine major forms of the disease: There are many treatments that can help keep muscles strong and flexible, and scientists are looking for new ones, too.The important thing is to get the treatment you need and find support.","For most types of muscular dystrophy, symptoms start to show up in childhood or in the teen years. In general, children with the condition: Some will also have symptoms like:","Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first one in your family to have it. The condition is caused by problems in your genes. Genes contain the information your cells need to make proteins that control all of the different functions in the body. When a gene has a problem, your cells can make the wrong protein, the wrong amount of it, or a damaged protein. You can get muscular dystrophy even if neither of your parents had the disease. This happens when one of your genes gets a defect on its own. But it’s rare for someone to get it this way. In people with muscular dystrophy, the broken genes are the ones that make the proteins that keep muscles healthy and strong. For example, those with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophies make too little of a protein called dystrophin, which strengthens muscles and protects them from injury.","Your doctor will need to check different parts of your child’s body to know if they have muscular dystrophy. They’ll start with a general physical exam. They’ll also ask you questions about your family’s medical history and the kind of symptoms you’re noticing in your child. They may ask: They also may ask you questions about how your child plays, moves, and speaks, as well as how they act at home and at school.The doctor may use different tests to check for conditions that can cause muscle weakness. Doctors can also test a sample of their blood to look for the genes that cause muscular dystrophy. Genetic tests can help diagnose the condition, but they’re also important for people with a family history of the disease who are planning to start a family. You can talk with your doctor or a genetics counselor to find out what the results of this test mean for you and your children.","Right now, there’s no cure for the disease. But there are many treatments that can improve symptoms and make life easier for you and your child. Your doctor will recommend a treatment based on the type of muscular dystrophy your child has. Some of them are: Scientists also are looking for new ways to treat muscular dystrophy in clinical trials. These trials test new drugs to see if they are safe and if they work. They often are a way for people to try new medicine that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if one of these trials might be a good fit for your child."

And these cells should have the correct shape and function. When you have myelodysplastic syndrome, your bone marrow isn't working the way it should. It makes low numbers of blood cells or defective ones.","Often, myelodysplastic syndromes cause no symptoms early in the disease. But its effect on different types of blood cells can cause warning signs that include: Call your doctor if you have these symptoms and concerns about MDS.",,"To figure out whether you have one of the myelodysplastic syndromes, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and history of other health problems. They might also:","Your doctor will decide on a treatment for your myelodysplastic syndrome that depends on the type of MDS you have and how severe it is. You and your doctor may just take a watchful waiting approach. Your doctor might just want to do regular check-ups if your symptoms are mild and your blood counts are holding up OK. Other times, you might get what your doctor may call a “low-intensity treatment.” These may include: Finally, you might need a “high-intensity treatment.”Myelodysplastic syndromes are a rare group of disorders in which your body no longer makes enough healthy blood cells. You might sometimes hear it called a “bone marrow failure disorder.” Most people who get it are 65 or older, but it can happen to younger people, too. It is more common in men. The syndromes are a type of cancer. Some cases are mild while others are more severe. It varies from person to person, depending on the type you have, among other things. In the early stages of MDS, you may not realize anything is even wrong. Eventually, you may start to feel very tired and short of breath. Other than stem cell transplants, there is no proven cure for MDS.

Nail Fungus,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/fungal-nail-infections,"A fungal nail infection is a common condition that can leave you with brittle, discolored nails, usually on your toes. Its formal name is onychomycosis, and it’s a lot like athlete’s foot. But instead of affecting the skin on the bottom of your feet or between your toes, it invades your nails. Fungi are tiny organisms you can only see through a microscope. Many different types can cause a nail infection. Sometimes they live on your skin and don’t make any trouble. But if you have a lot in one area, you might get infected. Don’t be embarrassed if you have toenail or fingernail fungus. It’s way more common than you think.","Symptoms are different depending on which type of fungal nail infection you have. They usually start mild and get more serious. It’s easy to ignore fungal nail infections at first, since you may not have any pain. But if you don’t treat them, it can hurt to put any pressure on the area. If an infection gets bad enough, it could even become hard to walk.","It’s a good idea to wash your hands and feet often. Use soap, and make sure you get between your fingers and toes. Keep your fingernails and toenails short and trimmed straight across. Wear socks that wick away (absorb) moisture. If your feet sweat a lot, change your socks once or twice a day, or take off your shoes and let your feet cool when you have the chance. Use antifungal powder or spray on your feet as well as in your shoes. Throw away old pairs of closed-toe shoes since fungi might be living in them. If you get manicures at nail salons, visit only the ones that disinfect tools after each client. You can also bring your own file and clippers from home. Ask that your cuticles not be cut, since this can cause tiny breaks in the skin that let germs in. Don’t share towels if someone else in your family has nail fungus. This will pass around the infection.See your doctor if you think you have nail fungus. You may need a prescription to treat it, whether that means taking a medicine by mouth or using a special cream. In severe cases, your nail may need to be removed so a healthy new one can grow in its place. Doctors can also use lasers to treat nail fungus. You get an infection when a crack in your nail or the skin around it allows fungus to get inside and grow. Since fungus thrives in dark, warm places, your toenails are more likely to be affected than your fingernails. Your toes also have less blood flow than your fingers, which makes it harder for your body to pick up on and prevent an infection.

Your treatment will depend on many things, including: Treatment may include: Radiation Therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays to kill cancer cells and stop them from growing. It is usually part of the standard treatment for early stage nasopharyngeal cancer. One type called IMRT delivers high-dose radiation directly to the tumor while minimizing damage to nearby healthy tissue. It may cause fewer side effects or complications than conventional radiation treatment to the nasopharynx, which can lead to: Chemotherapy.Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. By itself, it is not usually helpful for treating nasopharyngeal cancer. But it may help you live longer when combined with radiotherapy or biological drugs.Surgery. Surgery to remove the tumor is not often performed because of the tumor's location near nerves and blood vessels. It may cause permanent damage to the eye and other nearby structures. Not all people with nasopharyngeal cancer can have surgery. Your doctor will consider the location and stage of your tumor when discussing your treatment options. Biologic drugs. Biologic drugs affect how your body's immune system fights disease. They include monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab (Erbitux), pembrolizumab (Keytruda), and nivolumab (Opdivo). Biologics work differently than chemotherapy drugs and may be used more often in cases of advanced or recurrent cancer. Palliative therapy. The goal of palliative treatment is to control symptoms related to cancer and cancer treatment and make you as comfortable as possible. Clinical trials. If treatment does not work, consider joining a clinical trial. Researchers are always testing new ways to treat cancer, and they need your help. Ask your doctor or nurse if there are any clinical trials on nasopharyngeal cancer in your area."

NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis-pheochromocytoma-duodenal carcinoid syndrome, or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin. It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis.

Additional treatments may include methods to release stress and anxiety. Examples of these methods include stress management classes, assertiveness training, counseling, and limiting intake of alcohol and caffeine.  Sleep-related eating disorders are characterized by abnormal eating patterns during the night. Although it is not as common as sleepwalking, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder (NS-RED) can occur during sleepwalking. People with this disorder eat while they are asleep. They often walk into the kitchen and prepare food without a recollection for having done so. If NS-RED occurs often enough, a person can experience weight gain and increase their risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A closely related disorder, known as night eating syndrome (NES), is diagnosed when a person eats during the night with full awareness and may be unable to fall asleep again unless they eat. Symptoms of NES include the following and often persist for at least two months: NS-RED and NES differ, in that people with NES eat when they are conscious.

Junctional epidermolysis bullosa: While it also first appears in babies, this is a more severe form that causes blistering in deep layers of the skin. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa: If you have this type, your skin doesn’t have collagen to hold it together, or the collagen you do have doesn’t work well. This means the layers of your skin don’t seal together like they should.

The radiation comes either from a high-energy beam aimed at the cancer from outside of your body using a special machine, or from a radioactive substance put inside your body in or near the cancer. Chemotherapy. Whether you get it as pills or with a needle in a vein or muscle, the drugs travel throughout your body to kill the cancer. Your doctor might put it in your spinal fluid, a specific organ, or a space inside your body to target cancer cells in that area. You could get chemo before surgery to make a tumor smaller, after surgery, or both, or even if you don't have surgery.Targeted therapy. These drugs and antibodies stop cancer cells from growing and spreading in very specific ways. Because of how they work, they usually harm normal cells less than radiation and chemo. Laser and photodynamic therapy (PDT). This technique uses a special laser light to ""turn on"" special drugs that cancer cells have absorbed. This kills them and helps avoid damage to healthy tissue. Clinical trials. Scientists are studying new ways to treat cancer. Check the National Cancer Institute's web site and ask your doctor if a clinical trial would be a good fit for you, what you should consider, and how to sign up. Let your doctor know if you have any pain or shortness of breath. There are treatments for that so you can feel better."
Nonthrombocytopenic Idiopathic Purpura,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/henoch-schonlein-purpura-causes-symptoms-treatment,"The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.","The classic symptoms of HSP are rash, joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain, and/or related kidney disease, including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain, lungs, or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP:Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises. The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis. Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles. It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.","The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop.

Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.","The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present. A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.","The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present.

Normal Menstrual Cycle,https://www.webmd.com/women/normal-period,"A normal period (or normal menstruation) is different for every woman. Each month, one of your ovaries releases an egg. Meanwhile, your uterus gets ready to help your baby grow if that egg gets fertilized. If it does, you’re pregnant. If it doesn’t, your body sheds the lining of your uterus through your vagina. That’s your period. It happens, on average, every 28 days. Think about how old you were when you got your first period. Now think about how old you may be when you enter menopause.

Noroviruses,https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/norovirus-symptoms-and-treatment,"Norovirus is thought to be the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis (diarrhea and vomiting illness) around the world. It spreads easily through food and drink and can have a big impact on people's health.  Norovirus was originally called the Norwalk virus, after the town of Norwalk, OH, where the first confirmed outbreak happened in 1972. On average, noroviruses cause 19 million to 21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis in the U.S. per year and send more than 450,000 people to the emergency room, according to the CDC. They cause more than half of all foodborne disease outbreaks each year. There are many types of noroviruses, and exposure to one type may not protect you from the others. Although norovirus can strike year-round, it’s more common in the winter. People sometimes call it the “winter vomiting bug.” Noroviruses also are sometimes called food poisoning, because they can be transmitted through contaminated food. They aren't always the result of food contamination, though.","If you come down with a norovirus infection, you'll probably go from feeling completely healthy to absolutely miserable within a day or two after being exposed. Typical symptoms include nausea, vomiting (more often in children), watery diarrhea (more often in adults), and stomach cramps. Other norovirus symptoms include: Most of these symptoms aren't serious, but diarrhea and vomiting can deplete your body of the fluid it needs, and you can become dehydrated. Children and the elderly are most susceptible to dehydration, as well as malnutrition from not getting enough nutrients. If you have norovirus symptoms, your doctor can give you a stool test to confirm that you have the illness. But a norovirus diagnosis is usually made based only on symptoms. How long is norovirus contagious? It’s possible to shed the virus for up to 8 weeks. This means there’s a chance you could make other people sick. It usually gets less and less infectious over time. In most cases, you can return to work or school after you have been symptom-free for 48 hours. Food service workers are generally encouraged to wait 72 hours before they handle food. When should you call your doctor? Call your doctor’s office if you still have symptoms after 3 days. Also, watch for symptoms of dehydration, which may also require a doctor’s attention. In rare cases, vomiting could mean something more serious than norovirus. If your vomit is green or yellow, that could be a sign of a bowel obstruction. See a doctor right away.","People become infected with noroviruses when they eat or drink contaminated foods and beverages. Raw or undercooked oysters and raw fruits and vegetables have been blamed in some outbreaks. You can also get infected if you touch an object or surface that has been infected with the virus and then touch your nose, mouth, or eyes.Noroviruses thrive in close quarters, such as restaurants, day-care centers, and nursing homes, because they are hardy and highly contagious. They can survive temperature extremes in water and on surfaces. Once someone is infected from contaminated food, the virus can quickly pass from person to person through shared food or utensils, by shaking hands, or through other close contact. When someone with the virus vomits, the virus can spread through the air and contaminate surfaces. The virus also spreads through feces, meaning someone who doesn’t thoroughly wash their hands after using the bathroom can pass it along. Dirty diapers can also harbor norovirus. Young children, the elderly, and people who have weakened immune systems are particularly more vulnerable to noroviruses. The spread can be hard to control because it's contagious before symptoms appear. In other words, you can spread the virus before you know you’re sick.","If you have norovirus symptoms, your doctor can give you a stool test to confirm that you have the illness. But a norovirus diagnosis is usually made based only on symptoms.","Noroviruses, like other viruses, don't respond to antibiotics, which are designed to kill bacteria. No antiviral drug can treat norovirus, but in healthy people, the illness should go away on its own within 1 to 3 days. "
Norrbottnian Gaucher Disease,https://www.webmd.com/children/gauchers-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments,"If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. It's a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. Although there's no cure, it's important to keep in mind that depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break it down doesn't work right. The fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, causing problems. There are three main types of Gaucher disease. Type 1 is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe, but some people don't notice any problems at all. There are several treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Type 2 affects the brain and spinal cord. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms usually show up later in childhood.Gaucher disease can have many symptoms, including a swollen belly, bruising, and bleeding. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia. It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones. It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or you're the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support to help you face the challenges ahead. Reach out to your family and friends to get the backing you need. Ask your doctor about how to join a support group, where you can meet other people who are going through the same things you are.","How you feel depends on what type of Gaucher disease you've got. Type 1. It's the most common form. It usually doesn't affect your brain or spinal cord. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is mild and you won't notice any problems. Some symptoms you might have are: Type 2. It affects the brain and spinal cord and is very serious. Babies with this form usually don't live past age 2. The symptoms include: Type 3. This type also affects the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms are similar to type 2, but they usually show up later in childhood and take longer to get worse.Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease. This is the most severe type. An infant with this form usually lives only a few days. These symptoms are overwhelming for a newborn: Cardiovascular Gaucher disease (type 3C). This is rare and mainly affects your heart. You might have symptoms like:","Gaucher disease isn't something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It's an inherited condition that's caused by a problem with the GBA gene. You get the disease when both of your parents pass along a damaged GBA gene to you. You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don't have Gaucher disease.","When you go to your doctor, they might ask:If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child.","How you treat it depends on what type of Gaucher disease you have. Enzyme replacement therapy is one option for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps reduce anemia and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. Enzyme replacement therapy medications may include: Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat (Cerdelga) and miglustat (Zavesca). They are pills that curb the process in your body that forms the fatty materials when you have an enzyme shortage.There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from causing damage to the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease. Other treatments that can help your symptoms are:"

If it does, they'll choose to fix it either with surgery or without. They'll know what's best, based on your injuries. Here's what you can expect from both procedures. Manual realignment If your doctor decides your nose can be fixed without surgery, they'll have to do it within 1 to 2 weeks of your accident. If they wait any longer, the injury will begin to heal on its own, even if the bones are out of place.Your doctor will give you pain medication before the procedure. Then, they'll open your nostrils with a flat tool called a speculum. They'll use a special instrument to align your broken bones and cartilage back in place. Your doctor will use packing inside your nose. They'll also put a dressing on the outside. That'll keep your nose in place while it heals. They may give you antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery Your doctor probably will choose this option if your nasal fracture is severe or has gone untreated for more than 2 weeks. The goal is to put your bones back in their proper place and reshape your nose, if necessary. You'll get pain medication for the procedure. You might also have to have nasal surgery to fix any breathing problems. In many cases, you can go home the day of surgery. But you may have to stay home for about a week due to swelling and bruising."

This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver. Here are the best vitamin d foods for vegetarians. Your exposure to sunlight is limited. Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure. During the winter, vitamin D deficiency can be more prevalent because there is less sunlight available.You have dark skin. The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency.",The most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test. A level of 20 nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency.,"Treatment for vitamin D deficiency involves getting more vitamin D -- through diet and supplements. Although there is no consensus on vitamin D levels required for optimal health -- and it likely differs depending on age and health conditions -- a concentration of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is generally considered inadequate, requiring treatment. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine increased the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D to 600 international units (IU) for everyone ages 1-70, and raised it to 800 IU for adults older than age 70 to optimize bone health. The safe upper limit was also raised to 4,000 IU. Doctors may prescribe more than 4,000 IU to correct a vitamin D deficiency. If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin (sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.If you shun the sun, wear sunscreen, suffer from milk allergies, or adhere to a strict vegan diet, you may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced by the body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It also occurs naturally in a few foods -- including some fish, fish liver oils, and egg yolks -- and in fortified dairy and grain products.   Vitamin D is essential for strong bones because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities. But increasingly, research is revealing the importance of vitamin D in protecting against a host of health problems."

During this surgical procedure, the surgeon removes a small amount of the thickened septal wall of the heart to widen the outflow tract (the path the blood takes) from the left ventricle to the aorta. Ethanol ablation. First, a cardiologist (heart doctor) performs a cardiac catheterization to locate the small coronary artery that supplies blood flow to the septum. A balloon catheter is inserted into the artery and inflated. A contrast agent is injected to locate the swollen septal wall that narrows the passageway from the left ventricle to the aorta. When the abnormal area is located, a tiny amount of pure alcohol is injected through the catheter. The alcohol kills the cells on contact, causing a small ""controlled"" heart attack.

Most often, the pain is on the tip of your tongue or roof of your mouth. But sometimes it's in the front of your mouth or on the inner part of your lips. It often lasts for many years. About a third of people who have burning mouth syndrome say it started after some kind of dental work, an illness, or a course of medication. But most can't link it to any unusual event.","If you have burning mouth syndrome, your mouth can feel like you just drank hot coffee or had some hot soup. It feels different for each person. In general, burning mouth syndrome symptoms can include:  The pain may get worse throughout the day.

Organ Transplant,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/organ-transplant-overview,"You also may have a choice about whether the organ donor is deceased or living.Living donors are arranged through the individual transplant centers, according to UNOS. Another option, if you need a kidney transplant, is to contact the National Kidney Foundation's National Donor Family Council. Your living organ donor can be a spouse or other family member or an unrelated person such as a friend, Spicer says. The potential living donor's blood is tested to see if they are compatible with the recipient. But even if the blood types are not compatible, you may be able to find a program that allows proxy donors. This is when someone who doesn't match the intended donor can still donate the organ for someone else's use, and the intended donor goes to the top of the transplant list. Another possibility is called paired kidney exchange in which recipients who have donors that are not compatible can enter programs where they are able to ""swap"" donors. Those who need a transplant often ask if they can buy an organ. The answer is simple: No. In the United States, it is a felony to buy an organ. Though other countries allow the sale of organs, a doctor practicing in the U.S. would not place that organ, Spicer says.",,,,

Repeated physical stress and movement leads to inflammation in the specific point where your shinbone (tibia) meets the tendon from your kneecap (patella). It causes a painful lump below the kneecap. It can affect one or both knees and happens most often in kids who play sports or do activities that involve running, jumping, and changing direction quickly. For kids and teenagers who play sports, it’s one of the most common causes of knee pain.","The symptoms of OSD aren’t always the same for everyone. Some people might get a severe case and feel constant pain, and others might have a more mild case and only feel pain when they do certain activities. Symptoms can last from weeks to months and can recur until kids stop growing.

It usually happens to boys around age 13 or 14; and in girls much younger, usually around 11 or 12. It happens during puberty because of growth spurts. This is when girls and boys gain a lot of height very quickly.","Your child’s doctor will do a physical exam and look for signs of swelling, redness, pain, and tenderness. They may also order X-rays to take a closer look at the bones and the area where the tendon and shinbone attach.","Usually, kids with OSD don’t need any specific treatments. The condition gets better on its own over time. The symptoms tend to go away once their bones stop growing. If the pain is very uncomfortable, over-the-counter pain relievers can help. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen can help ease symptoms, as can naproxen. Physical therapy can sometimes help the pain, too. Certain exercises can help stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles in the thighs. This may ease some of the tension on the spot where the tendon and shinbone attach. Other exercises that strengthen the quadriceps can help, too, since they can stabilize the knee joint. There are also many things your child can do at home to help relieve the symptoms:"

Overactive Thyroid,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/causes-hyperthyroidism,"Two major hormones that affect how your body works are made in your thyroid. These are called thyroxine (T-4) and triiodothyronine (T-3). Your thyroid controls things like how fast your heart beats and how quickly you burn calories. It releases hormones to control your metabolism (all the things your body does to turn food into energy and keep you going). Another important hormone your thyroid makes is called parathyroid hormone. This helps keep a healthy amount of calcium in your blood. Hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid, can speed up your metabolism and cause unpleasant symptoms.","Common signs include:If you’re an older adult, you’re more likely to have subtle symptoms like a faster heart rate or being more sensitive to warm temperatures. Or you could just feel more tired after everyday activities. Certain medicines can mask the signs of hyperthyroidism. If you take beta-blockers to treat high blood pressure or another condition, you might not know you have it. Be sure your doctor knows about all the medications you take. When you first get hyperthyroidism, you may feel energetic. This is because your metabolism is sped up. But over time, this increase in your metabolism can break your body down and cause you to feel tired. Usually, hyperthyroidism develops slowly. If you’re young when you get it, the symptoms might come on suddenly.","Several conditions can cause hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease. This immune system disorder is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism (70% of cases). Normally, the antibodies in your blood go after bacteria, but if you have Graves’ disease, the antibodies turn on your thyroid instead. This causes the gland to make too much T-4 and T-3 thyroid hormone. Doctors aren’t sure why some people get Graves’ disease, but it tends to run in families. It’s more likely to affect women under the age of 40.Thyroid nodules (Plummer’s disease). These lumps of tissue in your thyroid can become overactive, creating too much thyroid hormone. Plummer’s disease is more common in older people. Thyroiditis. An infection or an immune system problem can cause your thyroid to swell and leak hormones into your bloodstream. With this condition, your thyroid is swollen for no clear reason. This is often followed by hypothyroidism, in which your thyroid doesn’t make enough hormones. These conditions are usually temporary. Thyroiditis can happen: You can also get hyperthyroidism if you get lots of iodine in your diet (like in a medication or supplement) or from taking too much thyroid hormone medication.","Your doctor will ask about your medical history and look for symptoms including a swollen thyroid, a fast pulse, moist skin, and shaking in your hands or fingers. They’ll give you tests that might include:","If you have thyroid eye disease but your symptoms aren’t severe, you can usually manage them by avoiding bright lights and wind, raising the head of your bed, and using eye drops. Your doctor may suggest a selenium supplement. In some cases, your doctor might prescribe a medication called teprotumumab-trbw (Tepezza).

But you don't get it from your parents, and you can't pass it on to your kids. A change in a gene, called a mutation, causes your body to make abnormal red blood cells. These cells don’t have proteins that shield them from your immune system. So your body breaks them down. Scientists call this process “hemolysis.”Some doctors believe PNH is related to weak bone marrow. People with a certain type of anemia, called aplastic anemia, are more likely to get PNH. The reverse is also true: People with PNH are more likely to get aplastic anemia, though not everyone does. In this condition, your bone marrow stops making new blood cells.","Your doctor will ask about your medical history and any symptoms you’ve noticed. They may also ask you: You will get routine blood tests. One will count the number of blood cells you have. You will probably also get other tests, such as flow cytometry, which checks on whether your red blood cells have the proteins that should protect them. Your doctor may also check your iron levels or get a sample of your bone marrow. If you have symptoms of a blood clot, they'll use other tests to look for those, too.","Most treatments for PNH aim to ease symptoms and prevent problems. Your treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms and disease are. If you have only a few symptoms from anemia, you may need: Pegcetacoplan (Empaveli) is a targeted therapy that can be prescribed for those who are new to treatment or are switching from eculizumab or revulizumab.Other treatments include: Blood transfusions. These help treat anemia, the most common PNH problem. Blood thinners. These medicines make your blood less likely to clot. Bone marrow stem cell transplant. This procedure is the only cure for PNH. To get one, you’ll need someone healthy, usually a brother or sister, to donate stem cells to replace the ones in your bone marrow. These are not “embryonic” stem cells. Usually, due to serious health risks, doctors offer a bone marrow transplant only to young people with severe PNH. If your doctor thinks it would work for you, talk with them about the risks and benefits. If your PNH doesn't get better with usual treatments, you may want to ask your doctor if you can take part in a clinical trial. These research studies try out new ways to treat PNH, before they’re available to everyone. Ask your doctor what’s involved and what you should consider before you sign up."

Platelet,https://www.webmd.com/heart/anatomy-picture-of-blood,"© 2014 WebMD, LLC. All rights reserved.Blood is a constantly circulating fluid providing the body with nutrition, oxygen, and waste removal. Blood is mostly liquid, with numerous cells and proteins suspended in it, making blood ""thicker"" than pure water. The average person has about 5 liters (more than a gallon) of blood. A liquid called plasma makes up about half of the content of blood. Plasma contains proteins that help blood to clot, transport substances through the blood, and perform other functions. Blood plasma also contains glucose and other dissolved nutrients. About half of blood volume is composed of blood cells: • Red blood cells, which carry oxygen to the tissues • White blood cells, which fight infections • Platelets, smaller cells that help blood to clot Blood is conducted through blood vessels (arteries and veins). Blood is prevented from clotting in the blood vessels by their smoothness, and the finely tuned balance of clotting factors.",,,,
Pleura,https://www.webmd.com/lung/picture-of-the-lungs,"© 2014 WebMD, LLC. All rights reserved.The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. The bronchioles eventually end in clusters of microscopic air sacs called alveoli. In the alveoli, oxygen from the air is absorbed into the blood. Carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, travels from the blood to the alveoli, where it can be exhaled. Between the alveoli is a thin layer of cells called the interstitium, which contains blood vessels and cells that help support the alveoli. The lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura. The same kind of thin tissue lines the inside of the chest cavity -- also called pleura. A thin layer of fluid acts as a lubricant allowing the lungs to slip smoothly as they expand and contract with each breath.",,,,
Pleuritis,https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pleurisy-basics,"Pleurisy is a type of chest pain. It affects a part of your body called the pleura. The pleura is a thin layer of tissue that wraps your lungs. They fit snugly within your chest, which is lined with another thin layer of pleura. These layers keep your bare lungs from rubbing against the wall of your chest cavity every time you breathe in. There’s a bit of fluid within the narrow space between the two layers of pleura to keep everything moving smoothly. When you’re healthy, you never notice your pleura at work. But if your pleura has a problem, you’ll feel it. When the pleurae are swollen and inflamed, they rub against each other in a very painful way each time your lungs expand. When you inhale deeply, cough, sneeze, or laugh, you’ll probably feel a sharp, stabbing pain in the area that’s affected. Most of the time, pleurisy happens because of an infection. If your doctor treats your infection, that can make it -- and the pain -- go away.",Chest pain from pleurisy has signs that can make it easy for your doctor to know that you have it. You’re likely to notice these things:,Bacterial infections such as pneumonia often cause pleurisy. It can also be caused by a virus such as the flu or by a fungus. Other things that can cause pleurisy are:,"Your doctor will ask you to describe the type of pain you feel when you breathe or cough, and they’ll ask whether it gets better or worse as the day goes on. They’ll listen to your lungs with a stethoscope to see if they’re making any strange noises. (Doctors often can hear the pleurae rubbing against each other.) You may also need to have tests, such as:","In order to treat your pleurisy the right way, your doctor needs to know what’s causing it: Some people with pleurisy have too much fluid built up between their two layers of pleura. Your doctor may need to remove some of the fluid. They may insert a thin needle into the space between your pleura to do this. Painkillers and steroid medications can help while you’re getting better. If coughing hurts too much, your doctor might prescribe medication (codeine) that can make you cough less. You might feel better if you lie on the side that’s causing you pain. As the pain starts to go away, try to breathe more deeply and cough up any phlegm you have."
Pollen,https://www.webmd.com/allergies/pollen_allergies_overview,"Some plants, including ragweed, grasses, and oak trees, make a fine powder called pollen that’s light enough to travel through the air. This is how these plants grow and reproduce themselves. More than 25 million Americans are allergic to pollen. Some people are allergic to tree pollen, which is in the air in spring. Others have a problem with grass pollen, which is more of a summertime issue. Still others have trouble with weed pollen, which is common in the fall. Plants that give off the most pollen include:","If you have a pollen allergy and go outside on a day when it’s flying around, your body will react as if it’s being invaded.

Polycythemia Vera,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/polycythemia-vera,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a blood cancer that begins in the marrow of your bones, the soft center where new blood cells grow. It causes your marrow to make too many red blood cells so your blood is too thick. You may be more likely to have clots, a stroke, or a heart attack. This disease gets worse slowly, usually over many years. It can be life-threatening if you don't get treatment, but the right care can help you live a long life. Most people who have PV don’t get diagnosed until they’re 60 or older, usually after a routine blood test. But it can happen at any age. Men get it more often than women. It's common to worry when you find out that you have cancer. Remember that everyone is different and that all cancers aren’t the same. With the support of your doctor, family, friends, and other people who have polycythemia vera, you’ll be in the best position to manage it. ","At first, you may not notice any problems. When they do show up, polycythemia vera symptoms can include: You may also feel pressure or fullness below your ribs on your left side. This might mean PV has enlarged your spleen, an organ that helps filter your blood.","Your bone marrow makes three types of blood cells: Red blood cells carry oxygen, white ones fight infections, and platelets clot your blood to stop bleeding. Most people with polycythemia vera have too many red blood cells. But it can also cause you to have too many white blood cells and platelets. PV is caused by a gene (either JAK2 or TET2) that doesn’t work the way it should. Most likely, the problem happened over the course of your life. Rarely, parents can pass these faulty genes to children.","Your doctor will start with a physical exam, including a check of your spleen. They’ll ask about your symptoms and see if your face is unusually red. You may have some blood tests, including:You may also need a bone marrow biopsy. The results can show your doctor if your bone marrow makes too many blood cells. For this test, your doctor will take samples of your marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. You lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then, your doctor uses a needle to take out a small amount of bone marrow. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. You can get it done in a clinic, a hospital, or your doctor's office. Questions for your doctor Before your appointment, it's a good idea to make a list of things to ask your doctor, such as:  ","If you don't have many symptoms, you might not need treatment for PV right away. Your doctor will keep a close watch on you. If you do need treatment, it will be aimed at lowering the amount of red blood cells your body makes and preventing blood clots and other complications. Your options include: Phlebotomy. This is often the first treatment for people who have polycythemia vera. Your doctor takes blood from your vein so you have fewer blood cells. It's a lot like donating blood. After it's done, your blood will be thinner, and it’ll flow more easily. You'll usually feel better, too. Some symptoms will ease, like headaches or dizziness. Your doctor will decide how often you need phlebotomy. Some people with PV don’t need any other treatment for many years. Low-dose aspirin. This keeps platelets from sticking together. That makes you less likely to get blood clots, which in turn makes heart attacks or strokes less likely. Most people with polycythemia vera take low-dose aspirin.Medicine to lower blood cells. If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea), a pill that lowers your red blood count and eases symptoms. Other drugs like interferon alfa (Intron A) or ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (Besremi) help your immune system cut back on making blood cells. You might take busulfan (Busulfex, Myleran) or ruxolitinib (Jakafi) if hydroxyurea isn’t helpful or if it causes severe side effects. If you have itching that doesn't go away, your doctor may give you antihistamines."
Polymyalgia Rheumatica,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis,"With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.  Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux.""","Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:  ",,,"There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called ""steroids"" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly."
Polyp,https://www.webmd.com/colorectal-cancer/guide/colorectal-polyps-cancer,"Colorectal cancer, sometimes called colon cancer, starts when cells that line your colon or rectum grow out of control. It’s the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men and women. In the U.S., about 72% of colorectal cancer cases start in the colon and 28% in the rectum. The colon is also called the large intestine, which is part of your digestive system. It absorbs water and nutrients from food after it moves through your stomach and small intestine. Solid waste (poop or stool) is stored in your colon before moving to the rectum. This 8-inch tube holds the waste until it leaves your body through the anus. Most colorectal cancers are ""silent"" tumors. They grow slowly, and you may not notice any symptoms until they’re large. But you can take some steps to prevent colorectal cancer, and you can cure it if you find it early. It’s important to have regular screening exams to spot cancer or precancerous areas, especially if you have a high risk of getting it.","You might not notice any signs of colorectal cancer. When you have them, they can include:",Anyone can get colorectal cancer. It’s most common among African Americans and people over age 50. The lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 22 for men and 1 in 24 for women. Things that can raise your chances of getting it include: Polyps might be more likely to contain cancer or carry a higher chance of cancer if:,"Your doctor may give you a physical exam and feel your belly for any swollen organs or masses. They might also order one or more of these tests to spot polyps or colorectal cancer:Tumors may bleed in amounts so small that only special tests can find it. This is called occult bleeding, meaning you probably can’t see it with the naked eye. These tests can look for blood in your poop: If either of these tests finds blood, your doctor will probably recommend a colonoscopy.","Treatment will depend on several things. You and your doctor should consider: You might have one or more of these treatments: Surgery Your doctor can take out polyps and small tumors that haven’t spread during a colonoscopy or through a laparoscopy, in which they put special tools and cameras into your belly through small cuts. If the cancer has spread, you might have surgery to remove part of your colon (partial colectomy). If cancer has spread to your liver and nowhere else, surgery is your best chance for a cure. But it’s not an option for everyone. Your doctor must be able to take out all the cancer. And you need enough healthy tissue left over for your liver to still work. If your tumor is very large, you might have chemotherapy to help shrink it before surgery.Procedures called ablation and embolization can also treat cancer that has spread to the liver. They can destroy tumors without removing them. Sometimes, doctors use high-energy radio waves or electromagnetic microwaves to kill cancer cells. Or they may inject the tumor with alcohol or freeze it with a metal probe. With embolization, a substance blocks blood flow to the tumor. Radiation therapy Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays, electron beams, or chemical agents called radioactive isotopes to attack cancer. The radiation is aimed directly at the tumor. It damages chromosomes in cancer cells so they can't multiply. External radiation therapy is the most common form for people with colorectal cancer. A machine aims a beam of radiation at your tumor. It's painless. Before treatment begins, a team of specialists, including a radiation oncologist, will use measurements from scans to find the exact spot to aim the radiation. They'll tattoo small dots on your body to show where to target the beam. This ensures that they get the same location at every treatment."
Pompe Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/pompe-disease,"If you or your child has Pompe disease, it's important to know that each case is different, and that doctors have treatments to help manage it. Pompe disease happens when your body can't make a protein that breaks down a complex sugar, called glycogen, for energy. Too much sugar builds up and damages your muscles and organs. Pompe disease causes muscle weakness and trouble breathing. It mostly affects the liver, heart, and muscles. You might hear Pompe disease called by other names such as GAA deficiency or type II glycogen storage disease (GSD). Although it can happen to anyone, it's more common in African-American people and some Asian groups.","What symptoms you have, when they start, and how much trouble they are can be very different for different people.A baby between a few months old and age 1 has early-onset, or infantile, Pompe disease. This could look like: If you're older when symptoms start -- as late as an adult in your 60s -- it's known as late-onset Pompe disease. This type tends to move slowly, and it doesn't usually involve your heart. You might notice:","You get Pompe disease from your parents. To get it, you have to inherit two flawed genes, one from each parent. You can have one gene and not have symptoms of the disease.","Many symptoms are similar to other medical conditions. To help figure out what's going on, your doctor may ask:You may need to get tests, depending on what symptoms you have, to rule out other conditions. If your doctor thinks you might have Pompe disease, it's often confirmed with these tests: It can take about 3 months to diagnose Pompe disease in a baby. It can take as long as 7-9 years for kids and adults. After doctors are sure, it's a good idea to test family members for the gene problem, too.","Early treatment, especially for babies, is critical to holding off the damage in the body. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) improves survival as well as cardiac, and motor function.   Three medications replace the missing protein and help your body process sugar correctly. You take them by injection. Nexviazyme, for those 1 year of age and older with late-onset Pompe disease"
Porcelain Inlay,https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-fillings,"Indirect fillings are similar to composite or tooth-colored fillings except they are made in a dental laboratory and require two visits before being placed. Indirect fillings are considered when not enough tooth structure remains to support a filling but the tooth is not so severely damaged that it needs a crown. During the first visit, decay or an old filling is removed. An impression is taken to record the shape of the tooth being repaired and the teeth around it. The impression is sent to a dental lab that will make the indirect filling. A temporary filling (described below) is placed to protect the tooth while the restoration is being made. During the second visit, the temporary filling is removed, and the dentist will check the fit of the indirect restoration. Provided the fit is acceptable, it will be permanently cemented into place. There are two types of indirect fillings -- inlays and onlays.Inlays and onlays are more durable and last much longer than traditional fillings -- up to 30 years. They can be made of tooth-colored composite resin, porcelain, or gold. An onlay can be used to protect a weakened tooth because it can cover the top chewing surface and distribute the forces around the tooth like a crown. Another type of inlay and onlay -- direct inlays and onlays -- follow similar processes and procedures as the indirect, but the direct is made in the mouth and can be placed in one visit. The type of inlay or onlay used depends on how much sound tooth structure remains and consideration of any cosmetic concerns.  ",,,,
Postcoital Test,https://www.webmd.com/infertility-and-reproduction/guide/fertility-tests-for-women1,"There is no single best test for infertility. Doctors use a variety of ways to identify any problems that might help cause fertility trouble. You may get a Pap smear, which is used to detect abnormal cells around the cervix. The test can detect cervical cancer and other problems with the cervix, or sexually transmitted diseases. Any of these can interfere with getting pregnant. To get pregnant, you need to release an egg each month -- called ""ovulation."" You may need tests that check for that.Your doctor may ask you to take a urine test at home for luteinizing hormone, or LH. This hormone shows up in high levels just before you ovulate. Your doctor also may check levels of the hormone progesterone in your blood. Increases in progesterone show that you are ovulating. On your own, you can check your body temperature each morning. Basal body temperature rises a bit just after ovulation. By checking it each morning, you'll learn your pattern of ovulation over several months. Your doctor may also run tests on your thyroid, or check for other hormonal problems, to rule out conditions that might cause missed or irregular ovulation.",,,"A doctor may order other tests to check for fertility problems. You may get a blood test to check your levels of follicle-stimulating hormone, or FSH, which triggers your ovaries to prepare an egg for release each month. High FSH can mean lower fertility in women. The FSH blood levels get checked early in your menstrual cycle (often on day 3).Clomiphene citrate challenge testing can be done with the FSH test. You take a pill of clomiphene citrate on the fifth through ninth days of your menstrual cycle. FSH gets checked on day 3 (before you take the medicine) and on day 10 (after). High FSH levels suggest you have lower chances of getting pregnant. Your doctor may also suggest a blood test to check for anti-müllerian hormone (AMH). AMH levels can give an idea of how well the ovaries function. This is called their ovarian reserve. Very low levels can suggest low ovarian reserve. Another exam is called postcoital testing. Your doctor examines your cervical mucus after you've had sex. Some studies suggest it may not be so useful.",
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/post-traumatic-stress-disorder,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), once called shell shock or battle fatigue syndrome, is a serious condition that can develop after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic or terrifying event in which there was serious physical harm or threat. PTSD is a lasting consequence of traumatic ordeals that cause intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Examples of things that can bring on PTSD include sexual or physical assault, the unexpected death of a loved one, an accident, war, or natural disaster. Families of victims can develop PTSD, as can emergency personnel and rescue workers.   Most people who have a traumatic event will have reactions that may include shock, anger, nervousness, fear, and even guilt. These reactions are common, and for most people, they go away over time. For a person with PTSD, however, these feelings continue and even increase, becoming so strong that they keep the person from going about their life as expected. People with PTSD have symptoms for longer than one month and can’t function as well as before the event that triggered it happened.","Symptoms of PTSD most often begin within 3 months of the event. In some cases, however, they don’t begin until years later. The severity and duration of the illness can vary. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have it much longer. Symptoms of PTSD often are grouped into four main categories, including:Young children with PTSD may have delayed development in areas such as toilet training, motor skills, and language. The intensity of PTSD symptoms may vary. You may have more symptoms when you feel stress in general, or when you encounter a specific reminder about what happened.","Everyone reacts to traumatic events differently. Each person is unique in their ability to manage fear, stress and the threat posed by a traumatic event or situation. For that reason, not everyone who has a trauma will develop PTSD. Also, the type of help and support a person receives from friends, family members, and professionals following the trauma may impact the development of PTSD or the severity of symptoms. PTSD was first brought to the attention of the medical community by war veterans; hence the names shell shock and battle fatigue syndrome. However, anyone who has had a traumatic event can develop PTSD. People who were abused as children or who have been repeatedly exposed to life-threatening situations are at risk for developing PTSD. Victims of trauma related to physical and sexual assault face the greatest risk for PTSD.You may be more likely to develop PTSD after a traumatic event if you have a history of other mental health problems, have blood relatives with mental health problems, or have a history of alcohol or drug abuse. How common is PTSD? About 3.6% of adult Americans -- about 5.2 million people -- have PTSD during the course of a year, and an estimated 7.8 million Americans will develop PTSD at some point in their lives. PTSD can develop at any age, including childhood. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men. This may be due to the fact that women are more likely to be victims of domestic violence, abuse, and rape.","PTSD isn’t diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the traumatic event happened. If symptoms of PTSD are present, the doctor will begin an evaluation by performing a complete medical history and physical exam. Although there are no lab tests to specifically diagnose PTSD, the doctor may use various tests to rule out physical illness as the cause of the symptoms. If no physical illness is found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional who is specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for the presence of PTSD or other psychiatric conditions. The doctor bases their diagnosis of PTSD on reported symptoms, including any problems with functioning caused by the symptoms. The doctor then determines if the symptoms and degree of dysfunction indicate PTSD. PTSD is diagnosed if the person has symptoms of PTSD that last for more than one month.","The goal of PTSD treatment is to reduce the emotional and physical symptoms, to improve daily functioning, and to help the person better manage with the event that triggered the disorder. Treatment for PTSD may involve psychotherapy (a type of counseling), medication, or both. Medication Doctors use certain antidepressant medications to treat PTSD -- and to control the feelings of anxiety and its associated symptoms -- including: Certain blood pressure medicines are also sometimes used to control particular symptoms: Experts discourage the use of tranquilizers such as lorazepam (Ativan) or clonazepam (Klonopin) for PTSD because studies have not shown them to be helpful, plus they carry a risk for physical dependence or addiction.Psychotherapy Psychotherapy for PTSD involves helping the person learn skills to manage symptoms and develop ways of coping. Therapy also aims to teach the person and their family about the disorder, and help the person work through the fears associated with the traumatic event. A variety of psychotherapy approaches are used to treat people with PTSD, including:"

You might also avoid things that remind you of the event, and lose interest in things that you enjoy. Symptoms usually start within 3 months of a trauma. But they might not show up until years afterward. They last for at least a month. Without treatment, you can have PTSD for years or even the rest of your life. You can feel better or worse over time. For example, a news report about an assault on television may trigger overwhelming memories of your own assault. PTSD interferes with your life. It makes it harder for you to trust, communicate, and solve problems. This can lead to problems in your relationships with friends, family, and coworkers. It also affects your physical health.

Preeclampsia and High Blood Pressure,https://www.webmd.com/baby/preeclampsia-eclampsia,"Preeclampsia, formerly called toxemia, is when pregnant women have high blood pressure, protein in their urine, and swelling in their legs, feet, and hands. It can range from mild to severe. It usually happens late in pregnancy, though it can come earlier or just after delivery. Preeclampsia can lead to eclampsia, a serious condition that can have health risks for mom and baby and, in rare cases, cause death. If your preeclampsia leads to seizures, you have eclampsia. The only cure for preeclampsia is to give birth. Even after delivery, symptoms of preeclampsia can last 6 weeks or more. You can help protect yourself by learning the symptoms of preeclampsia and by seeing your doctor for regular prenatal care. Catching preeclampsia early may lower the chances of long-term problems for both mom and baby.","Preeclampsia can happen as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy, but that’s rare. Symptoms often begin after 34 weeks. In a few cases, symptoms develop after birth, usually within 48 hours of delivery.

Your doctor will talk with you about when to deliver based on how far along your baby is, how well your baby is doing in your womb, and the severity of your preeclampsia. If your baby has developed well, usually by 37 weeks or later, your doctor may want to induce labor or do a cesarean section. This will keep preeclampsia from getting worse. If your baby isn’t close to term, you and your doctor may be able to treat mild preeclampsia until your baby has developed enough to be safely delivered.

"Pregnancy, Ectopic",https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That’s because the egg can’t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus.  ","At first you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts. Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain.

They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.","Because a fertilized egg can’t survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don’t have serious health problems. They’ll use one of two methods: medication or surgery.Medication. If your fallopian tube hasn’t ruptured and your pregnancy isn’t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there’s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It’s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won’t be able to take methotrexate if you’re breastfeeding or have certain health problems.

"Pregnancy, Extrauterine",https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss.

It can be hard to know if you just have a few symptoms before your period, or if it’s really PMS.One way to think about it is to ask the question: “Do these changes get in the way of my regular life? Do they cause trouble at work or with family and friends?” If you answer yes, it might be PMS. Another way to know is if you have symptoms in the 5 days before your period, for 3 months in a row. Women with PMS deal with it in lots of ways. You can make changes to improve your diet, sleep, and exercise. You can also learn ways to relax your mind and body. If what you try doesn’t seem to work, you could talk to your doctor.","Even though PMS is common, doctors don’t know exactly what causes it.

If you have glasses already, this might be the option for you. They’re eyeglasses with two different prescriptions in one lens. The top part corrects for distance vision. The lower section helps you see objects up close. Progressive lenses are similar to bifocals, but there’s a gradual or blended transition between the two prescriptions instead of separate sections Contact lenses can also treat presbyopia. You might try: KAMRA Inlay is an FDA-approved implant. That means a doctor will surgically place it in one eye. It can work for people with presbyopia who haven’t had cataract surgery. Other procedures are available as well. Ask your doctor what’s best for you.  Sometime in your 40s, it gets harder to see close up, but you can see things far away just fine. This is called presbyopia. In spite of the big name, it isn’t a disease. It’s a natural part of the aging process. And it’s easy to correct. Presbyopia is often confused with farsightedness, but the two are different. Presbyopia happens when the natural lens in the eye gets less flexible. Farsightedness is from a misshaped eyeball that causes light rays to focus incorrectly once they have entered the eye."

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help your symptoms so you can live better with the disease. It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure. With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Eventually, it can lead to heart failure.  ",You may not notice any symptoms for a while. The main one is shortness of breath when you're active. It usually starts slowly and gets worse as time goes on. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include:,"Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs:","If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, they will ask you about your medical history. They may also ask you:Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram: This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. CT scan: This can show enlarged pulmonary arteries. A CT scan can also spot other problems in the lungs that could cause shortness of breath.","Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. Ask your doctor what your options are and what to expect. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension.Most people also get treatment to improve their breathing, which makes it easier to be active and do daily tasks. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you’re short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. It helps you live longer when you have pulmonary hypertension. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners. Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren’t enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. A surgeon creates an opening between the right and left sides of the heart. This surgery can have serious side effects."
"Purpura, Henoch-Schonlein",https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/henoch-schonlein-purpura-causes-symptoms-treatment,"The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.","The classic symptoms of HSP are rash, joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain, and/or related kidney disease, including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain, lungs, or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP:Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises. The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis. Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles. It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.","The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved.

A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.","The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present.

Paroxysmal Sleep,https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects your ability to wake and sleep. People with narcolepsy have excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may also suddenly fall asleep at any time, during any type of activity. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early stages of sleep, then the deeper stages, and finally (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People with narcolepsy go into REM sleep almost immediately in the sleep cycle and sometimes while they’re awake. Type 1 narcolepsy comes with a sudden loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles (cataplexy). Type 2 is narcolepsy without cataplexy. In many cases, narcolepsy isn’t diagnosed and therefore isn’t treated..","In REM sleep, we can dream and have muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Those symptoms may include:","Experts don’t know what causes narcolepsy. They think it involves multiple things that come together to cause problems in your brain and disturb your REM sleep.Scientists are getting closer to finding genes linked to the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in your brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may happen because your brain has a hard time making a chemical called hypocretin. They’ve also found problems in parts of the brain involved in controlling REM sleep. Risk factors for narcolepsy include your age. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can show up at any age. If you have a family history of narcolepsy, your risk of getting it is 20 to 40 times higher.",Symptoms of narcolepsy can look like those of other health problems.

You might need a team of specialists that includes doctors, surgeons, psychologists, speech and language therapists, and more. Surgery tends to play a key role in treatment. Skull surgery: Most children have the first surgery to reshape their skull before they’re 18 months old. For children under 3 months, this can be done with very small openings in the head. For older children, doctors use traditional surgery. Typically, children will need two to four skull surgeries over the course of their lives. Midface surgery: Some children may need it to correct problems in their jaw and bring their midface bones forward. Children are usually at least 6 before this surgery is done. Treatment for breathing problems: Some children have blockages that make it hard for them to breathe. This leads to problems such as sleep apnea. To correct these problems, your doctor may suggest these:For severe cases, doctors may do a surgery called a tracheostomy. The doctor creates an opening in the child’s neck directly to the windpipe to allow for easier breathing. It’s done for children too young to have other surgeries to correct breathing problems. Other treatments: Your child may also need:Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare birth defect that affects the shape of a baby’s skull and face. When you’re born, the top of your skull isn’t one solid piece. It’s actually made up of several bones with special joints between them. This allows it to expand so your brain has room to grow. Normally, the skull bones come together only after your head reaches its full size. But with this syndrome, the plates join together too early. The skull can’t expand as the brain grows, which affects the shape of the head and face. There are three types of Pfeiffer syndrome. All of them affect a child’s appearance, but types 2 and 3 are more severe. They can cause delays in development, as well as other issues with the brain and nervous system. Treatment starts soon after birth. Because the condition varies among people, the right care depends on your child’s signs and symptoms."
Phakomatosis TS,https://www.webmd.com/children/tuberous-sclerosis,"If you have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), your cells don’t stop dividing when they should. This means you get tumors in lots of places in your body. They aren’t cancer, but they can cause problems where they’re growing. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. Every case is different. You might get TSC in certain parts of your body, and TSC might affect someone else differently. The tumors can look like thick or light patches on your skin, and if they're in your lungs, they can cause breathing problems. Treatments can help you manage your symptoms and live an independent life. Between 1 million and 2 million people around the world have this condition.","Symptoms usually show up early, shortly after birth. But they can also appear later in life. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Tumors in your eyes can make you see double or give you blurry vision.In other places in your body, you may have patches of different color skin and dark or light growths that might look like warts. In your mouth, tuberous sclerosis can weaken the enamel on your teeth or make your gums overgrow.","You get TSC because of a problem in your genes. For most people, it’s caused by changes that happened when your cells were first coming together or when you were just an embryo. About a third of people inherit TSC from a parent. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it.","With so many different symptoms, diagnosing this condition can be tricky. Your doctor will talk with you before doing any testing, asking questions such as: Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. These can include: ","Your treatment will depend on your particular case. Doctors target the places where the tumors are growing. If TSC is affecting your kidneys, doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. You may need surgery to remove the tumors. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant.If you have tumors in your brain, sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them."

To figure out if you have it, your doctor will do one or more of these tests:  ","Your doctor will first take you off the drug that caused this syndrome. Often, people with NMS get treatment in a hospital intensive care unit. The goal is to bring down your fever and give you fluids and nutrition.Medicines used to treat NMS include: If these medicines don't help, your doctor might try electroconvulsive therapy. During this treatment, you’re asleep and pain-free. A small electric current travels through your brain to trigger a seizure. This won’t hurt you, and it should help your symptoms. NMS usually gets better in 1 to 2 weeks. After recovery, most people can start taking antipsychotic medicine again. Your doctor might switch you to a different drug.

Phenylketonuria (PKU),https://www.webmd.com/children/pku-test,"A health care worker at the hospital will take a blood sample no earlier than 24 hours after your baby is born. If you gave birth outside a hospital, bring your infant to a doctor in a day or two to get all the newborn screenings. Usually, the blood is taken through a prick in your newborn’s heel. It’s put on a special paper and sent to a lab. Your baby’s doctor will share the results with you.",,,"If PKU isn’t diagnosed and treated right away, it can cause lasting problems, including:","If your child has PKU, they need to be on a special, lifelong diet that’s low in Phe. You should start them on it as soon as possible, ideally within a week or 10 days of birth.Your baby will be put on a Phe-free infant formula. They may be able to have some breast milk, too. Some kids need a stricter diet than others. A dietitian with expertise in PKU can make an eating plan specific to your child so they grow and thrive. Your child probably will need to eat carefully measured portions of fruits, vegetables, and low-protein cereals, bread, and pasta. Foods with higher levels of Phe generally are off-limits. These include: Since your child’s diet is limited, they’ll need to drink a special formula that contains protein (minus the Phe) and other nutrients they need. Regular blood tests and doctor visits help to show whether the diet is working. Some people take a medicine that helps process Phe such as sapopterin (Kuvan). It’s more likely to work in those with mild or special forms of PKU. Your child will continue their special meal plan, but they may have a bit more freedom while taking the medication. The control of phenylketonuria levels is a lifelong process. Adults with uncontrolled high concentrations of PKU can be treated with the medication pegvaliase-pqpz (Palynziq) to help reduce levels.Your newborn seems perfect. They've got 10 fingers and toes and  a hearty appetite. But even healthy-looking babies can have problems you can’t see. A simple blood test looks for rare conditions, including phenylketonuria (PKU), which can harm your baby’s growing brain. PKU is a rare genetic condition that affects metabolism -- the way your body turns food into energy. Babies with PKU can’t make an enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine (Phe) – an amino acid found in protein. Amino acids regulate almost all of the metabolic processes in the human body. If Phe builds up in the blood, it causes damage. Every baby in the United States is tested for PKU as part of newborn screenings that check for many other conditions, too. There’s no cure. But with treatment, your baby can grow into a healthy adult."
Physical Abuse,https://www.webmd.com/children/child-abuse-signs,"When you think of child abuse, your first thought may be of a child with bruises or other marks that raise red flags. But the signs aren’t always so clear. Abuse can be physical, sexual, or emotional. Or a child may be neglected, meaning their caregivers don’t provide for basic needs, like food or safety. What makes abuse even harder to stop is that most of the time, the abuser is someone the child knows. They may be reluctant to say something because they may want to protect that person or is afraid of what the abuser will do if they speak up. It’s important to know how to recognize different types of abuse, and what you can do if you suspect it.","Abuse can be hard to recognize. Kids can get cuts and bruises or show signs of stress for lots of reasons that are a normal part of childhood.

Physical Therapy,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-physical-therapy,"These licensed health professionals engage in specific graduate training in physical therapy. You may hear them called PTs or physiotherapists.  As of 2016, to be eligible to sit for the national exam, you need to graduate from an accredited higher educational institution with a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) degree. An additional state exam must also be passed to earn a license.  Physical therapists evaluate your condition and develop a care plan that guides your therapy. They may perform hands-on treatments for your symptoms. They also teach you special exercises to help you move and function better. In most states, you can go directly to a physical therapist without a referral from your doctor. Or your doctor might prescribe it. Check your insurance policy to see if you need a prescription to cover the cost. If you have a serious illness or injury, a PT won’t take the place of other doctors, but they will work with your doctors and other health care professionals to guide treatments.

"Physical Urticaria, Cholinergic Type",https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/guide/hives-urticaria-angioedema,"There are several types of hives, including: Acute urticaria. These are hives that last less than 6 weeks. The most common causes are foods, medications, and infections. Insect bites and diseases may also be responsible. The most common foods that cause hives are nuts, chocolate, fish, tomatoes, eggs, fresh berries, and milk. Fresh foods cause hives more often than cooked foods. Certain food additives and preservatives may also be to blame.

PI,https://www.webmd.com/lung/copd/alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency-rare,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disease, which means it’s passed down to you from your parents. It can cause serious lung or liver disease. You may also hear it called AAT deficiency. Symptoms often include trouble breathing and jaundiced, or yellow, skin. There's no cure, but treatments can help you manage your liver and breathing problems. You get the disease because your liver doesn't make enough of a protein called alpha-1 antitrypsin, or AAT. You need AAT to protect your lungs. Without it, infections and other irritants, like tobacco smoke, break down parts of your lung even faster. If you have AAT deficiency, you might not have breathing symptoms until you're in your 20s or 30s. When they start, you could feel short of breath or wheeze when you breathe, just like someone who has asthma. For some people, AAT deficiency can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary obstructive disease (COPD). When you have COPD, you often have symptoms of emphysema, a serious condition that makes it hard for you to push air out of your lungs. COPD can make you cough up mucus, make you wheeze or have trouble breathing, and make your chest feel tight.You also might have chronic bronchitis, an irritation of your airways that makes you cough a lot and causes breathing problems. You'll probably need to take medicine through an inhaler that you carry around, like the type that people with asthma use. This is something you'll need to do the rest of your life. Keep in mind that no two cases of AAT deficiency are alike. Not everyone gets severe symptoms. With treatment, you’ll probably still be able to work, exercise, and enjoy many of your favorite hobbies. Reach out to a circle of friends and family, and ask your doctor about support groups. It can help to talk to people who understand what you're going through.","You might not know you have the disease until you're an adult. Most people get it between the ages of 20 and 40. You may feel short of breath, especially when you try to exercise. You also could start to wheeze or have a whistling sound when you breathe.You may also get a lot of lung infections. Other warning signs include: If AAT deficiency causes problems with your liver, you could have symptoms like: A newborn baby might have: It’s rare, but some people also get a skin disease called panniculitis. It causes hardening of the skin along with painful lumps or patches.","Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency runs in families. If you have it, you got it from faulty genes that both your parents passed down to you. Some people get the genes but don't have any symptoms. Or they have a mild version of the disease. The broken genes you get from your parents cause you to have a low level of AAT protein in your blood. It can build up in the liver instead of going into your bloodstream. That buildup in your liver causes liver disease. The shortage of AAT protein in your bloodstream leads to lung disease.","Your doctor may ask you questions such as: Your doctor will also listen to your breathing with a stethoscope to check for wheezing or other signs that your lungs aren't working right. You need to get blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests check to see if you have the broken genes that cause AAT deficiency. They also look to see how much of the protein you have in your bloodstream. Your doctor will also tests your lungs and liver to see how much damage the condition has caused. For example, a chest X-ray might shows signs of emphysema. A special blood test checks the oxygen level in your arteries, a sign of how well your lungs work. You might breathe into a tube to see how much air you're getting into your lungs. Another blood test checks for problems with your liver. You may also get a liver biopsy. For this test, your doctor uses a very thin needle to take some cells from your liver and check them for signs of damage.","Although there’s no cure for AAT deficiency, you can raise the amount of AAT protein in your blood, which protects you against more lung damage. Doctors call this augmentation therapy. You may also have this treatment if you get emphysema. Augmentation therapy is also called replacement therapy. You get a new supply of AAT protein that comes from the blood of healthy human donors. You get the treatment once a week. The replacement alpha-1 gets into your body through an IV. You can have this done at home with the help of a technician, or you can go to a doctor's office. The goal of augmentation therapy is to slow or stop the damage in your lungs. It won't reverse the disease or heal any damage you already have. You’ll need these treatments for the rest of your life. Depending on how you're doing, you also may get medication that you breathe into your lungs with an inhaler. Doctors call this a bronchodilator, meaning that it opens your airways. If your breathing trouble leads to low levels of oxygen in your blood, you might need to get extra oxygen through a mask or nosepiece. Your doctor will also give you a referral for pulmonary rehab to help you breathe better."

Then you'll have special tests that check your memory, behavior, language, and other mental functions. These are usually pencil and paper tests. You'll answer questions in writing and may be asked to draw certain objects. The doctor may also recommend a blood test that looks at your DNA to see if you have the gene that causes Pick's disease.To get a better picture of what's happening in your brain, your doctor may order imaging tests, such as: You may also have a lumbar puncture.

It can progress slowly, but usually it steadily gets worse over time. Some people live as long as 10 years with the disease. Your doctor can recommend treatment to help you deal with many of your symptoms. They may suggest behavioral therapy to help control any dangerous behavior and antidepressants to help with agitation or aggression.Pick's disease is a kind of dementia similar to Alzheimer's but far less common. It affects parts of the brain that control emotions, behavior, personality, and language. It's also a type of disorder known as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) or frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Your brain uses a transport system to help move around the nutrients it needs. This system is made of proteins that like railroad tracks guiding trains guide nutrients where they need to go. The proteins that keep the tracks straight are called tau proteins. When you have Pick's disease, the tau proteins don't work the way they should. You may also have more of them in your brain than other people. These abnormal clumps of tau proteins are called Pick bodies. Pick bodies ""derail"" your transport system. The track is no longer straight, and nutrients in the brain can't get where they need to go. This causes brain damage that can't be reversed. Around 50,000 to 60,000 people in the U.S. have Pick's disease. It's usually diagnosed between the ages of 40 and 75, but it can happen in people as young as 20. It affects more men than women.

Among the things they may ask you:,"Antibiotics do not heal a pilonidal cyst. But doctors have any number of procedures they can try. Here are some options: Incision and drainage: This is the preferred method for a first pilonidal cyst. Your doctor makes a cut into the cyst and drains it. They remove any hair follicles and leaves the wound open, packing the space with gauze.Advantage -- It’s a simple procedure done under local anesthesia, meaning just the area around the cyst is numbed. Disadvantage -- You have to change the gauze often until the cyst heals, which sometimes takes up to 3 weeks. Marsupialization: In this procedure, your doctor makes a cut and drains the cyst, removing pus and any hair that are inside. They’ll sew the edges of the cut to the wound edges to make a pouch. Advantages -- This is outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. It also lets the doctor make a smaller, shallower cut so that you don’t need to take out and repack gauze daily. Disadvantages -- It takes about 6 weeks to heal, and you need a doctor specially trained in the technique. Incision, drainage, closing of wound: In this technique, the cyst is drained, but it’s not left open. Advantage -- You don’t need to pack gauze because your doctor fully closes the wound right after surgery. Disadvantages -- You’re more likely to have more problems with the cyst down the road. It’s harder to remove the entire cyst with this method. It’s usually done in an operating room with a specially trained surgeon.' Other surgical procedures include complete cyst and cyst wall excision along with the pilonidal sinus tracts, the use of fibrin glue, and taking (core out) only diseased tissue and the cyst out with punch biopsies."
Pneumonia,https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-pneumonia-basics,"Pneumonia is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital. It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in your lungs (your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream. Anyone can get this lung infection. But infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. That’s because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it. You can get pneumonia in one or both lungs. You can also have it and not know it. Doctors call this walking pneumonia. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  If your pneumonia results from bacteria or a virus, you can spread it to someone else.  Lifestyle habits, like smoking cigarettes and drinking too much alcohol, can also raise your chances of getting pneumonia.","Your symptoms can vary depending on what’s causing your pneumonia, your age, and your overall health. They usually develop over several days. Common pneumonia symptoms include: Along with these symptoms, older adults and people with weak immune systems might be confused or have changes in mental awareness, or they might have a lower-than-usual body temperature. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of infection. Or they might vomit, have a fever and a cough, and seem restless or tired. If you have a new cough, fever, or shortness of breath, call your doctor to ask about whether it could be COVID-19. Illness with the new coronavirus can also lead to pneumonia.","Bacteria, viruses, or fungi can cause pneumonia. Common causes include:Some people who are in the hospital get “ventilator-associated pneumonia” if they got the infection while using a ventilator, a machine that helps you breathe. If you get pneumonia while you’re in a hospital and aren’t on a ventilator, that’s called “hospital-acquired” pneumonia. But most people get “community-acquired pneumonia,” which means they didn’t get it in a hospital.","Your doctor will start with questions about your symptoms and your medical history, like whether you smoke and whether you’ve been around sick people at home, school, or work. Then, they’ll listen to your lungs. If you have pneumonia, they might hear cracking, bubbling, or rumbling sounds when you breathe in. If your doctor thinks you might have pneumonia, they’ll probably give you tests, including: If your symptoms started in the hospital or you have other health problems, your doctor might give you more tests, such as:","Your doctor can tell you which treatment is right for you. If you have bacterial pneumonia, you’ll get antibiotics. Make sure you take all of the medicine your doctor gives you, even if you start to feel better before you’re through with it. If you have viral pneumonia, antibiotics won’t help. You’ll need to rest, drink a lot of fluids, and take medicine for your fever. If your symptoms are severe or if you have other conditions that make you more likely to have complications, your doctor may send you to the hospital. While you’re there, your doctor will probably give you fluids or antibiotics through an IV tube. You may even need oxygen therapy or breathing treatments.

It could also be related to problems that make your body produce too much insulin, which can affect your ovaries and their ability to ovulate (or release eggs).  Long-term low-grade inflammation may also play a role. White blood cells produce substances to fight infection, and that can cause the ovaries to produce androgens. Most people with PCOS have high levels of androgens. Transgender men (also known as female-to-male transsexual people, or FTMs) are highly prone to getting PCOS. Hormone therapy may or may not be a factor in that. That’s because so many other things – including insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and high levels of androgens – come into play with PCOS. In fact, some studies have shown that while hormone therapy can cause changes to the ovaries in transgender men, it doesn’t necessarily cause PCOS.",,"If you aren’t planning to get pregnant, your doctor might prescribe hormonal birth control, like the skin patch or the pill. These medications can help lower your risk of endometrial cancer, get your periods on track, clear up acne, and lessen extra body hair. If you do want to get pregnant, fertility medications can help your ovaries release eggs.Ask your doctor about medications to treat body hair and acne. You should also see your doctor if you’re having: These symptoms might not be caused by PCOS but could signal other serious health issues."
Polymyositis,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyositis,"Polymyositis is a type of muscle disease called an inflammatory myopathy. It inflames your muscles and their related tissues, like the blood vessels that supply them. It can cause muscle weakness and pain, often on both sides of your body. There’s no cure for this ongoing (chronic) condition, but there are treatments that can help with symptoms.","The symptoms of polymyositis are caused by inflammation in the muscles. The muscle weakness affects both sides of the body equally. The condition tends to target the muscle groups that are closest to the trunk of the body -- the hips, shoulders, thighs, upper arms, upper back, and neck. If you have it, you may notice you have trouble lifting your arms over your head, walking up flights of stairs, rising from a chair, or carrying things. In some cases, it may be hard to swallow food, but this is unusual. You may or may not have pain in the areas where the muscles are weak. Over time, the muscles may atrophy, meaning they waste away or become less bulky. The condition often worsens slowly, and you might not notice symptoms for months. Muscle weakness may be one of the first symptoms you do notice. You may also feel you just can’t do all the things you used to. You may also have: ","No one knows the exact cause of polymyositis. But doctors do know that it’s an autoimmune condition, which means the body can attack its own tissues. This is what causes the problems. It’s more common in people with other autoimmune diseases like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It’s also more common among people with HIV. Most people who have polymyositis get diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 60. It’s very rare in children, and it affects women more often than men. Risk factors for polymyositis include:  ","There are no simple tests to diagnose polymyositis. It often takes time before doctors know for sure you have it. Your doctor will consider your medical history, and your family’s, to rule out other conditions. You may also get tests such as: ","Polymyositis is a chronic condition. That means that once you have it, it sticks around. But there are ways to help manage it.

PPH,https://www.webmd.com/lung/pulmonary-arterial-hypertension,"Pulmonary hypertension is a life-threatening condition that gets worse over time, but treatments can help your symptoms so you can live better with the disease. It may take some planning, but plenty of people who have it find ways to do all the things they love, just as they did before they were diagnosed. Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure. With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood through those arteries, and after a while the heart muscle gets weak. Eventually, it can lead to heart failure.  ",You may not notice any symptoms for a while. The main one is shortness of breath when you're active. It usually starts slowly and gets worse as time goes on. You may notice that you can't do some of the things you used to without getting winded. Other symptoms include:,"Sometimes doctors can't find a reason for high blood pressure in the lungs. In that case, the condition is called idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Genes may play a role in why some people get it. In other cases, there is another condition that's causing the problem. Any of these illnesses can lead to high blood pressure in your lungs:","If you have shortness of breath and see your doctor, they will ask you about your medical history. They may also ask you:Your doctor may order tests, including: Echocardiogram: This ultrasound picture of the beating heart can check blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. CT scan: This can show enlarged pulmonary arteries. A CT scan can also spot other problems in the lungs that could cause shortness of breath.","Pulmonary hypertension varies from person to person, so your treatment plan will be specific to your needs. Ask your doctor what your options are and what to expect. First, your doctor will treat the cause of your condition. For example, if emphysema is causing the problem, you'll need to treat that to improve your pulmonary hypertension.Most people also get treatment to improve their breathing, which makes it easier to be active and do daily tasks. Oxygen therapy, when you breathe pure oxygen through prongs that fit in your nose, will help if you’re short of breath and have low oxygen levels in your blood. It helps you live longer when you have pulmonary hypertension. If you are at risk for blood clots your doctor will recommend blood thinners. Other medicines improve how well your heart works and keep fluid from building up in your body. If you have severe pulmonary hypertension, your doctor may prescribe medications called calcium channel blockers. These medicines lower blood pressure in the lungs and the rest of the body. If calcium channel blockers aren’t enough, your doctor may refer you to a specialized treatment center. You may need more targeted therapies that can open up your narrowed blood vessels. They may be pills, medicines you breathe in, or drugs that are given through an IV. Options include: In more severe cases, or if medicines don't help, your doctor may recommend a lung transplant or a procedure called atrial septostomy. A surgeon creates an opening between the right and left sides of the heart. This surgery can have serious side effects."
PPS (Post-Polio Syndrome),https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/polio-vaccine-ipv,"If you had the polio vaccination prior to 2000, you may have received the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which was made from a live poliovirus. Although the live virus vaccine was highly effective at protecting against polio, a few cases of polio per year were caused by the oral vaccine itself. In 2000, the U.S. switched to the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Using an inactive (dead) form of the virus that cannot cause polio, the IPV is given as a shot in the arm or leg.",,"Some people who get the polio shot get a sore, red spot where the shot was given, but otherwise the vaccine is very safe. Most people don't have any problems with it at all. However, the polio vaccine, like any medicine, could potentially cause serious problems, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk that the vaccine could cause any serious harm is extremely small.Polio, an infectious disease caused by a virus that lives in the throat and intestinal tract, was once the leading cause of disability in the U.S. Since the introduction of the polio vaccine in 1955, the disease has been eradicated in the U.S. But the disease is still common in some developing countries and until it is eradicated worldwide, the risk of it spreading to the U.S. still exists. For that reason, the polio vaccination remains one of the recommended childhood immunizations. In most parts of the U.S., polio immunization is required before a child can start school.",,

Your doctor may want your child to see a specialist who focuses on children's hormones and growth, called a pediatric endocrinologist. They’ll look for signs of puberty, but they may also check: Blood tests check levels of hormones. X-rays help find out if your child's bones are maturing too early. MRI or CT scans can rule out a tumor.","If your doctor can find a cause, they’ll treat that. In some cases, doctors can use a drug to block sex hormones and prevent further development. A man-made version of GnRH stops the pituitary gland from sending out gonadotropins.The doctor can give your child a shot once a month or every 3 months, or they can put a small implant under the skin of your child's upper arm that works for a year. The part of the body where they get the shot or implant may hurt a bit, or their skin might get irritated around that spot, but there don’t seem to be any long-term side effects.

"Pregnancy, Cervical",https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That’s because the egg can’t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus.  ","At first you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts. Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting, or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.",You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus. You’re more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control.,"Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.","Because a fertilized egg can’t survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don’t have serious health problems. They’ll use one of two methods: medication or surgery.Medication. If your fallopian tube hasn’t ruptured and your pregnancy isn’t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there’s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It’s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won’t be able to take methotrexate if you’re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don’t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You’ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG."
Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension,https://www.webmd.com/baby/preeclampsia-eclampsia,"Preeclampsia, formerly called toxemia, is when pregnant women have high blood pressure, protein in their urine, and swelling in their legs, feet, and hands. It can range from mild to severe. It usually happens late in pregnancy, though it can come earlier or just after delivery. Preeclampsia can lead to eclampsia, a serious condition that can have health risks for mom and baby and, in rare cases, cause death. If your preeclampsia leads to seizures, you have eclampsia. The only cure for preeclampsia is to give birth. Even after delivery, symptoms of preeclampsia can last 6 weeks or more. You can help protect yourself by learning the symptoms of preeclampsia and by seeing your doctor for regular prenatal care. Catching preeclampsia early may lower the chances of long-term problems for both mom and baby.","Preeclampsia can happen as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy, but that’s rare. Symptoms often begin after 34 weeks. In a few cases, symptoms develop after birth, usually within 48 hours of delivery. They tend to go away on their own.",Things that can increase your chance of getting preeclampsia include:,"You have preeclampsia if you have high blood pressure and at least one of these other signs: To confirm a diagnosis, your doctor might give you tests including:","The only cure for preeclampsia and eclampsia is to give birth. Your doctor will talk with you about when to deliver based on how far along your baby is, how well your baby is doing in your womb, and the severity of your preeclampsia. If your baby has developed well, usually by 37 weeks or later, your doctor may want to induce labor or do a cesarean section. This will keep preeclampsia from getting worse. If your baby isn’t close to term, you and your doctor may be able to treat mild preeclampsia until your baby has developed enough to be safely delivered. The closer the birth is to your due date, the better it is for your baby. If you have mild preeclampsia, also known as preeclampsia without severe features, your doctor may prescribe:Your doctor also may tell you to stay in the hospital so they can watch you closely.

Premature Ejaculation,https://www.webmd.com/men/what-is-premature-ejaculation,"Premature ejaculation (PE) is when you have an orgasm before intercourse or less than a minute after you start. There is no set time when a man should ejaculate during sex, but if you ejaculate and lose your erection this soon, you and your partner may feel there’s not enough time to enjoy it. It can be frustrating and even embarrassing, but it’s a common issue for men. Between 30% to 40% have it at some time in their life. So, keep in mind -- it’s not something to worry about if it happens only occasionally.",,"The cause is not really known. But your brain chemistry could be at least partly the reason. Men who have low levels of the chemical serotonin in their brains tend to take a shorter time to ejaculate. Emotional factors can play a role: Stress Depression Anxiety Guilt Relationship problems Lack of confidence or poor body image Concern over your sexual performance Negative feelings about the idea of sex (sexual repression)Some physical conditions may also cause PE, including: Unusual hormone levels Irregular levels of neurotransmitters (an imbalance of the chemicals in your brain that pass messages or impulses to the rest of your body) Inflammation or an infection in your prostate or urethra (the tube that runs from your bladder and sends pee out of body) Genetic traits you inherit from your parents Sometimes PE can be a problem for men with erectile dysfunction (ED). That’s when the penis doesn’t remain firm enough for sex. Men who are worried they could lose their erection may develop a pattern of rushing to ejaculate. It can be a hard habit to break. Treating the erectile dysfunction may make the premature ejaculation go away. There are many medication options.  ","Your doctor probably will start by asking if you’ve always had the problem or if it’s a new thing. They may ask about your sex life or your relationships. You’ll probably get a physical exam, too. If your doctor thinks emotional issues are causing your PE, they may refer you to a mental health professional who works with people who have trouble with sex. If a physical problem is causing it, they might recommend that you see a doctor called a urologist, who specializes in conditions that affect your urinary system.","Ninety-five percent of men are helped by behavioral techniques that help control ejaculation. Stop and start:You or your partner stimulate your penis until you feel like you’re going to have an orgasm. Stop the arousal for about 30 seconds or until the feeling passes. Start the stimulation again and repeat three or four more times before you ejaculate. The Squeeze:It works the same way as the start and stop method. But, when you feel like you’re reaching orgasm, you or your partner squeezes the head of your penis until you lose the erection. Repeat this a few times before ejaculating. Some men find that if they think of something else during sex they can last longer. If those don’t work for you, you can try a few other things: Strengthen your muscles:Weak pelvic floor muscles sometimes contribute to PE. Kegel exercises may help strengthen them. Find the right muscles to tighten by stopping your urine in midstream. Hold them tight for 3 seconds and then release them for 3 seconds. Do this 10 times, at least three times a day.Wear a condom:It may desensitize you enough so you can last longer. Get busy before you “get busy”: Some men find that masturbating a few hours before sex helps them stay in control during intercourse. Seek counseling:A psychologist or psychiatrist can help you work through problems like depression, anxiety, or stress that may be contributing to your PE. If none of these help enough, your doctor may talk with you about medication. While there aren’t any drugs specifically approved to treat PE, medicines used to treat other things may help in some cases. This is called an off-label use. These include: Antidepressants: A side effect of some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is delayed orgasm. But these medications also have side effects that include nausea and drowsiness. They also can throw a wet blanket on your desire to have sex. So, it’s possible you’re trading one problem for another. You and your doctor will decide what’s right for you. Tramadol: This is a pain reliever that can delay ejaculation. It may be prescribed if antidepressants don’t help. This medicine is addictive, so it may not be an option for you. Anesthetic creams or sprays:You put these on the head of your penis to make it less sensitive. Leave it on for about 30 minutes. It must be washed off before sex so you don’t lose your erection or cause loss of sensation for your partner.  Medications for erectile dysfunction: These drugs may also help  men maintain an erection. They include sildenafil citrate (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil HCI (Levitra). "
Premature Ovarian Failure,https://www.webmd.com/menopause/premature-ovarian-failure,"Inside the ovaries are small sacs, called follicles. They hold eggs as they grow and mature. Girls are usually born with about 2 million “seeds” that turn into these follicles, which last through menopause. If you have primary ovarian insufficiency, your follicles either run out (your doctor may call this depletion) or don’t work properly (also called dysfunction). Doctors aren’t sure why this happens.  This condition may be more likely if your mother or sister had it. Other things that may make it more likely include:",You may not know your ovaries aren’t working normally. Some women with premature ovarian failure still have periods and may even get pregnant. But many who have this condition have trouble getting pregnant.

If you do have this condition, you may get more tests to check on the cause.","Although there’s no cure, there are treatments that can ease symptoms and potential complications related to low estrogen levels. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is the most common. This treatment usually combines estrogen and progestin, although your doctor may prescribe other forms. You may take it by mouth, put it on your skin, or place it in your vagina. Make sure that you and your doctor talk about the possible side effects and risks if you’re considering this type of treatment. Doctors usually prescribe calcium and vitamin D supplements to prevent bone loss, which can happen when estrogen levels drop. If you don’t work out, you’ll need to make fitness a habit, since weight-bearing exercises can help keep your bones strong and your heart healthy. If you were hoping to get pregnant but find that you have primary ovarian insufficiency, you may want to talk with a counselor and also work with your doctor to understand what your options may be to start or expand your family. Primary ovarian insufficiency used to be called premature ovarian failure. It’s a condition that affects women well before they should reach menopause. A healthy woman’s ovaries produce estrogen. This hormone controls menstrual periods and makes you fertile (able to get pregnant). With age, your ovaries eventually stop making estrogen. Sometimes, the ovaries stop working long before menopause is expected. (The average age for menopause is 51.) If you’re younger than 40 and your ovaries no longer make eggs and your periods have stopped, it may be primary ovarian insufficiency."
Premature Senility Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/children/progeria,"Progeria is also known as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) or the “Benjamin Button” disease (named after the short story and movie ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’). It’s  a rare genetic condition that results in  a child's body aging rapidly. A mutation in the LMNA gene causes progeria. Most kids with progeria don’t live past age 13. The disease affects people of all sexes and races equally. About 1 in every 4 million babies are born with it worldwide. A single mistake in a certain gene causes it to make an abnormal protein. When cells use this protein, called progerin, they break down more easily. This leads kids with progeria to age quickly.","There are usually no symptoms when a baby is born, but they start to show signs of the disease during their first year. They develop physical traits including:As children with progeria get older, they get diseases you'd expect to see in people age 50 and older, including bone loss, hardening of the arteries, and heart disease. Children with progeria usually die of heart attacks or strokes. Progeria doesn't affect a child's intelligence or brain development. A child with the condition isn't any more likely to get infections than other kids, either.","A mutation in the lamin A (LMNA) gene causes progeria. The gene makes a protein that holds together the center of a cell. With progeria, the body makes an abnormal form of lamin A called progerin, which leads to rapid aging. Researchers haven’t found any risk factors for progeria. It isn’t inherited or passed down in families.","The symptoms are  noticeable. It's likely that a pediatrician will spot them during a routine checkup.If you see changes in your child that seem like symptoms of progeria, make an appointment with your pediatrician or family doctor. Your doctor will do a physical exam, test hearing and vision, measure pulse and blood pressure, and compare your child's height and weight to other kids the same age. If your pediatrician is concerned, you may need to see a specialist in medical genetics who can confirm the diagnosis with a blood test. Before the genetic blood tests were availables, doctors could only diagnose progeria with X-rays and observation.","There's no cure for progeria, but researchers are working on finding one. One clinical trial is looking at a kind of cancer drug, FTIs (farnesyltransferase inhibitors), to see if it can help slow the disease. Treatments can help ease or delay some of the disease's symptoms. Medication and diet changes. Your child's doctor may suggest drugs and changes to your child’s diet to lower cholesterol or prevent blood clots. A low dose of aspirin every day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke. Growth hormone can help build height and weight. The FDA has approved lonafarnib (Zokinvy) to prevent the buildup of defective progerin, which can affect the heart. Physical and occupational therapy can help your child keep moving if they have stiff joints or hip problems. Surgery. Some children may have coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty to slow the progression of heart disease. At home. Kids with progeria are more likely to get dehydrated, so they need to drink plenty of water, especially when they're sick or it's hot. Small meals more often can help them eat enough, too. Cushioned shoes or inserts can ease discomfort and encourage your child to play and stay active. Sunscreen. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Reapply it every 2 hours, or more if your child is sweating or swimming."

Pressure Sores,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/pressure-sores-4-stages,"This is the mildest stage. These pressure sores only affect the upper layer of your skin.  Symptoms: Pain, burning, or itching are common symptoms. The spot may also feel different from the surrounding skin: firmer or softer, warmer or cooler.You may notice a red area on your skin. If you have darker skin, the discolored area may be harder to see. The spot doesn’t get lighter when you press on it, or even 10 to 30 minutes after you stop pressing. This means less blood is getting to the area. What to do: The first and most important thing to do with any pressure sore is to stop the pressure. Change your position or use foam pads, pillows, or mattresses. If you spend a lot of time in bed, try to move at least once every 2 hours. If you’re sitting, move every 15 minutes. You may need someone to help you. Wash the sore with mild soap and water and dry it gently. It may help to eat a diet high in protein, vitamins A and C, and the minerals iron and zinc.

Preventing Falls,https://www.webmd.com/healthy-aging/guide/prevent-slips-falls,"Clear the clutter. Get a friend or family member to help you clear your walkways of anything you can trip over. Phone cords, electric wires, pet bowls, and other things can cause trouble. Move it out of the way, or think about getting rid of it. Light it up. As you get older, you need more light to see. Make sure your light switches are easy to reach, and at the bottom and top of any stairs. Turn the lights on before you get up to move around. And always know where your flashlights are in case the power goes out. Hold the rails. If you have stairways, put handrails on both sides of them and put treads on each step. Hold on to a railing when you walk up or down the stairs, and go slowly. If you are carrying anything, make sure you can see each step.Cut the skids. Use self-adhesive, non-skid mats or safety treads in bathtubs, showers, and pools. Put non-skid rugs on bathroom floors and pads under rugs on bare floors. Grab hold. Consider getting grab bars installed on both sides of toilets and bathtubs. Put handrails in the shower and wherever else you need them. Toss the throw rugs, or make sure they're secured with double-sided tape. More than half of all falls happen at home. This simple fix can help you keep you safe. Move it where you use it. Keep items you use often -- food, cans, dishes, clothes -- where you can easily reach them. This way you won't have to climb on a stool. Wear sturdy shoes inside and outside. Solid footwear helps with your balance. Avoid slippers or walking barefoot. Once your home is a safe zone, you’re less likely to have accidents.

When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option.Primary biliary cholangitis is a disease that damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis. These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need. When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should. This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant."
Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia,https://www.webmd.com/children/primary-ciliary-dyskinesia,"PCD mainly causes problems in your respiratory system.

About half of the people who have PCD have a condition doctors call “situs inversus.”It causes your internal organs to be reversed.A condition called “situs ambiguus,” or “heterotaxy,” is present in 12% of people who have PCD. It also involves misarranged organs -- namely, your heart, liver, intestine, and spleen. PCD can also affect your fertility. If the cilia and flagella (tails) of sperm don’t work, they can’t get to where they need to go. About half of men with PCD are infertile. In women, the cilia in the fallopian tubes might not be able to push an egg into the uterus.",,"PCD is a genetic condition caused by a mutation (change) in any one of 32 genes that researchers have identified (so far). It’s what’s known as an “autosomal recessive disorder.” That means you get one mutated gene from each parent, and that both parents are carriers of the condition but don’t have any symptoms of it.

At your appointment, you’ll answer questions about your symptoms and get a physical examination. Your doctor will put a finger into your vagina or rectum and put pressure on the nerve to check on it. You might also get an imaging test with an MRI machine. It uses powerful magnets and radio waves to take a picture of your body’s internal organs. Your doctor may also give you a pudendal nerve block. This is a shot you get in your pelvis to numb the nerve and see if your symptoms go away.","Most people with pudendal neuralgia get treatment with a combination of physical therapy, lifestyle changes, and medicines. Sit up straight or stand more often to help with nerve pain. This can take pressure off the pudendal nerve. Don’t do squats or cycle. Certain exercises can make pudendal neuralgia worse. Go for physical therapy. It relaxes and stretches the muscles at the lower end of your pelvis, known as the pelvic floor. This can ease pressure that may irritate the pudendal nerve. If pudendal neuralgia makes it hard to control your bladder or bowels, physical therapy can help with that, too. Try prescription medication. Muscle relaxants may help relieve symptoms of pudendal neuralgia. Drugs used to treat other conditions, like depression or epilepsy, might also help. If these don’t work, your doctor may give you a shot of medications that numb the nerve or lower inflammation, which lessens pressure. These may take several weeks to fully take effect. In rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to remove anything that presses on the nerve. You may also get a small electrical device put under your skin to stimulate the nerve and interrupt the pain signals it sends to the brain.Pudendal neuralgia is a condition that causes pain, discomfort, or numbness in your pelvis or genitals. It happens when a major nerve in the lower body is damaged or irritated, and it can make it hard to use the bathroom, have sex, or sit down. The pain comes and goes.

Having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) means that you have high blood pressure in the arteries that go from your heart to your lungs . It's different from having regular high blood pressure. With PAH, the tiny arteries in your lungs become narrow or blocked. It's harder for blood to flow through them, and that raises the blood pressure in your lungs.

Smoking isn't known to cause LAM: more than half of people with LAM lung disease have never smoked. LAM is so rare that it's unknown how often it really occurs. For example, during a three-year study by researchers, fewer than 250 people with LAM were identified in the U.S. Fewer than 2,000 women are known to have LAM today. LAM is not cancer, but appears similar to other conditions in which benign tumors grow uncontrollably. LAM lung disease shares some features with a different condition called tuberous sclerosis.","Most people with LAM lung disease experience shortness of breath. Other symptoms include wheezing and cough, which may be bloody. Often, people with LAM develop a sudden pneumothorax (collapsed lung). This occurs when one of the cysts near the lung's edge ruptures, allowing inhaled air to compress the lung. A pneumothorax usually causes pain and shortness of breath. If muscle cells migrate to areas outside the lungs, LAM can cause other symptoms: In a few people with LAM, discovery of these benign tumors outside the lungs is the first sign of LAM lung disease.","No one knows what causes pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

But doctors often recommend collecting a sample of lung tissue (biopsy) to confirm the diagnosis. Lung biopsies can be collected in different ways: A physician (pathologist) then examines lung biopsy tissue, helping make the diagnosis of LAM lung disease with greater certainty.","The drug sirolimus (Rapamune) is the first drug approved to treat lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The drug has been found to help improve the lung capacity in patients, allowing them to breathe easier. In addition, inhaled bronchodilators (albuterol, ipratropium) can help open the airways, reducing shortness of breath in some people. Patients with LAM lung disease should avoid smoking cigarettes as well as second hand smoke. Because hormones like estrogen seem to be involved in LAM lung disease, treatments that manipulate hormone levels could help some people with LAM. A number of hormone-related treatments have been tested in women with LAM lung disease: In clinical trials that tested these therapies, some women were helped, but others were not.

These can give your doctor an idea of how much fluid is in your lungs and where it is. Blood tests. These check your oxygen level. They can also look for signs of infection or anemia, a lack of red blood cells. Heart tests. These can rule out conditions such as heart failure (when your heart doesn’t pump blood through your body the way it should).","Treatment aims to get the oxygen levels in your blood up to where they should be, so your organs get what they need. In some cases, your doctor might give you an air mask and later go to a breathing tube and ventilator (a machine that helps you breathe).Your doctor will also treat other conditions that might be causing ARDS.

Pure Cutaneous Histiocytosis,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cancer-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis,"LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs, liver, brain, spleen, or lymph nodes. In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs.  LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.Along with your bones, it can affect your:  Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap, a common skin condition. Liver. Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears, in the neck, and in other places, can swell up.

About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: ","Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy. That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam, your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: ","As with some types of cancer, doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy. Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and haematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too."

It's likely that antibiotics will be administered immediately to avoid the spread of the infection. Intravenous (IV) antibiotics are given, usually requiring admission to the hospital for initial treatment. The treatment, however, may be continued on an outpatient basis at home with the assistance of a home health nursing service. Initially, empiric antibiotics are chosen to cover a wide range of infections. If the bacteria can be identified, antibiotics specific to that organism are used.

These are some of the ways people can get it: It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water, and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you’ll have and how severe they may be. But just because you’re exposed to the bacteria doesn’t mean you’ll become sick with the disease.","If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis, you’re likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks. There are different types of tularemia that each have their own specific symptoms. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common variety of the disease. Symptoms can include: Oculoglandular tularemia affects the eyes. Symptoms can include:Oropharyngeal tularemia affects the mouth, throat, and digestive system. It’s the form of the disease that’s most often caused by eating undercooked meat from a wild animal or drinking water that’s contaminated. Symptoms can include:",Tularemia is rare. There were only 229 reported cases in the United States in 2018. People get it most from tick bites or contact with a contaminated animal. The following can also increase your risk for developing tularemia:,"It can be hard to diagnose tularemia because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. Your doctor will test you to confirm the bacteria is present. They may also order a chest X-ray to check for signs of pneumonia. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, either injected or by mouth. If you have complications like pneumonia or meningitis, you’ll also need treatment for these conditions.

Your child’s doctor will do a physical exam and ask about their symptoms and health history. They’ll probably want to get blood tests to check on your child’s blood sugar and insulin levels.","Treating Rabson-Mendenhall usually requires a team of doctors, surgeons, dentists, and others. Your family may also want to seek counseling to work through the emotions of having a rare disease. Since there’s no cure, treatment often focuses on specific symptoms, such as surgery to remove cysts or fix dental problems. Sometimes, doctors use high doses of insulin or certain drugs that help the body use insulin, but often these don’t work for very long. Experts are looking for better treatment options for hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) linked to severe insulin resistance. These treatments have shown some good results so far, though more research is needed:One of the most basic things your body does is get energy from your food and deliver it to your cells. It’s a lot like gassing up your car, but in this case, sugar provides the energy. Usually, a hormone called insulin controls the process. It tells the sugar when to move out of your blood and into your cells.  If you have Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, this process breaks down. Your body can’t use insulin like it needs to. It’s a very rare condition. When insulin can’t do its job, it impacts how your body grows. And the effects start even before birth. Babies who have it tend to be smaller than usual and struggle to grow and gain weight.  Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is part a group of conditions that doctors call severe insulin resistance syndromes. These include Donohue syndrome and type A insulin resistance syndrome."

Radiation Therapy for Cancer,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-to-expect-from-radiation-therapy,"Late side effects from radiation therapy take months and sometimes years to show up and usually don’t go away. But not everyone will have them. These problems happen when radiation damages your body. For example, scar tissue can affect the way your lungs or your heart works. Bladder, bowel, fertility, and sexual problems can start after radiation to your belly or pelvis. Another possible late effect is a second cancer. Doctors have known for a long time that radiation can cause cancer. And research has shown that radiation treatment for one cancer can raise the risk for developing a different cancer later. Factors that can affect that risk include the amount of radiation used and the area that was treated. Talk with your doctor about the potential risk and how it compares to the benefits you’ll get from radiation therapy.Radiation therapy treats cancer by using high-energy waves to kill tumor cells. The goal is to destroy or damage the cancer without hurting too many healthy cells. This treatment can cause side effects, but they’re different for everyone. The ones you have depend on the type of radiation you get, how much you get, the part of your body that gets treatment, and how healthy you are overall. There’s no way to predict how radiation will affect you. You may have few or only mild side effects from your treatment; someone else may have a lot of problems or very severe ones. When you get radiation therapy, you’ll work with a doctor who specializes in this type of medicine. It's important to talk with them about how the treatment might make you feel and what you can do to feel better. If the therapy makes you uncomfortable, speak up. If you keep your health team informed, they can help you get through treatment.",,"Only people who get radiation to the scalp or the brain may have hair loss. Others won't. If it does happen, it’s usually sudden and comes out in clumps. In most cases, your hair will grow back after therapy stops, but it may be thinner or have a different texture. Some people choose to cut their hair short before treatment begins to make less weight on the hair shaft. If you lose hair on top of your head, be sure to wear a hat or a scarf to protect your scalp from the sun when you go outside. If you decide to buy a wig, ask the doctor to write a prescription for one and check to see if it's covered by your insurance or is a tax-deductible expense.",,

Reactive Attachment Disorder,https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mental-health-reactive-attachment-disorder,"Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is a condition found in children who may have had grossly negligent care and don’t form healthy emotional attachments with their primary caregivers -- usually their mothers -- before age 5. Attachment develops when a child is repeatedly soothed, comforted, and cared for, and when the caregiver consistently meets the child's needs. It is through attachment with a loving and protective caregiver that a young child learns to love and trust others, to become aware of others' feelings and needs, to regulate their emotions, and to develop healthy relationships and a positive self-image. The absence of emotional warmth during the first few years of life can negatively affect a child's future.","RAD can affect every aspect of a child's life and development. When babies and young children have RAD they may:When children get older their RAD tends to take on two patterns, inhibited and disinhibited. Common symptoms with inhibited RAD include: Common symptoms with disinhibited RAD include:","RAD develops when attachment between a young child and their primary caregiver doesn’t happen or is interrupted due to grossly negligent care. This can happen for many reasons, including: Other risk factors for RAD include these home and parental situations:","As with adults, mental disorders in children are diagnosed based on signs and symptoms that suggest a particular condition. If a child has symptoms, the doctor may do a complete medical history and physical exam, including a review of the child’s developmental milestones. There are no lab tests to diagnose RAD, but the doctor may use various tests to see what may be causing the symptoms. Tests may include neuroimaging or blood tests, to see if physical illness or medication might be causing symptoms. If the doctor can’t find a physical cause for the symptoms, they will likely refer the child to a child and adolescent psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses in children and teens. They’ll assess the child to rule out other causes for their unusual behavior, such as autism spectrum disorder. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate children for mental disorders. They base their diagnoses on what they’ve been told about the symptoms, and on observation of children’s attitudes and behaviors.","Treatment of RAD has two important goals. The first is to ensure that the child is in a safe environment. This is especially important in cases where the child has been abused or neglected. The second goal is to help the child develop a healthy relationship with an appropriate caregiver. Treatment for RAD often focuses on the caregiver. Counseling may help address issues that are affecting the caregiver's relationship with -- and behavior toward -- the child. Teaching parenting skills also can help improve the relationship and develop attachment. Treatment may also include play therapy. This technique allows the child and the caregiver to express their thoughts, fears, and needs in the safe context of play. There is no medication to treat RAD itself. However, the doctor may sometimes use medication to help manage severe behavioral symptoms, such as explosive anger or problems sleeping. The use of so-called holding therapies and ""rebirthing"" techniques is controversial. There’s no scientific evidence to support the effectiveness of such interventions and some evidence that indicates that it is actually not safe."
Recessive X-linked Ichthyosis,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/what-is-ichthyosis,"Ichthyosis is a group of about 20 skin conditions that cause skin dryness and scaling. The condition gets its name from the Greek word for fish, because the skin looks like fish scales. You might also hear it called fish scale or fish skin disease. People with this condition lose the protective barrier that keeps moisture in their skin. They also make new skin cells too quickly or shed old cells too slowly. This leads to a buildup of thick, scaly skin. Most cases of ichthyosis are mild. Ichthyosis can't be cured, but treatments can relieve the scaling and make you feel more comfortable.","In the inherited forms, symptoms appear at birth or in the first few months of life. Dry, scaly skin is the main symptom. The scales form on only some parts of the body, such as the: The scales can be white, gray, or dark brown. They might have thick or thin cracks running through them. Dryness and scaling get worse in cold, dry weather. They usually improve in warmer weather. Other signs of ichthyosis are: Many people with ichthyosis also have eczema, a red, itchy rash.","Inherited ichthyosis is a genetic condition. That means it’s passed down to you from your parents. Genes are the codes that tell your body to make proteins, which determine how your body looks and functions. When there are changes or mutations to a gene, it can cause disease. Ichthyosis gene mutations affect the proteins that protect your skin and keep it moist. They also affect how quickly your body sheds or grows new skin cells. Ichthyosis usually shows up in early childhood. If both of your parents have the gene, you’re likely to have a more serious condition than if only one of them has the gene. Acquired ichthyosis shows up in adulthood. Doctors don’t know what causes it, but people with it often have other conditions, including: Some medicines might also trigger the condition:","Sometimes it’s so mild that it looks like regular dry skin. If the dryness and scaling bother you, see a dermatologist -- a doctor who treats skin problems -- for treatment. They may:","It can't be cured, but treatments can help you manage dry and scaly skin.Rub cream, lotion, or ointment onto your skin every day to add moisture. Look for rich creams that have any of these ingredients: lanolin, alpha hydroxy acids, urea, or propylene glycol. Products with ceramides or cholesterol also keep skin moist."

Living with rectal prolapse can cause embarrassment and affect your quality of life.

Typically, you’ll first experience rectal prolapse after you have a bowel movement. The first time, or first few times, the rectum may return inside on its own. Later, you may feel like something has fallen out of your body, or you just feel something down there that isn’t normal. In those cases, you may be able to push the rectum back in yourself. Additional symptoms of rectal prolapse can include: Early on, rectal prolapse may look like hemorrhoids slipping out of your anal opening, but these are two different conditions. Hemorrhoids are swollen blood vessels in your anus or lower rectum that may cause itching, pain, and blood on the toilet paper when you wipe after you poop. Your doctor can diagnose whether you have rectal prolapse or hemorrhoids.","More women develop rectal prolapse than men, especially women older than 50. In general, older people who have had a history of constipation or problems with their pelvic floor have a higher chance of having the problem. Any of these health conditions could put you at higher risk for rectal prolapse:","Your doctor can do a rectal exam. While you may hesitate to do this, your doctor may ask you to sit on a toilet and poop or at least try to go. This is helpful because it allows your doctor to see the prolapse. You may need some other, more advanced tests to diagnose rectal prolapse, especially if you have other related conditions:","The most common treatment for rectal prolapse is surgery to put the rectum back in place, and there are several types. The kind of surgery your doctor recommends will depend on factors such as your overall health, age, and how serious your condition is. The two most common types of surgery: If your rectal prolapse is very minor and it is caught early, your doctor might have you treat it by taking stool softeners to make it easier to go to the bathroom and by pushing the rectum’s tissue back up the anus by hand. But, typically, you will eventually need to have surgery to fix rectal prolapse."
Recurrent Multiple Myeloma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/relapsed-recurrent-multiple-myeloma,"Because this condition is rarely curable, nearly all people who have it and live through treatment will have a relapse at some point. It can come back in the same place it started or in other areas of your body. Most people who have it go through cycles of remission (when doctors can’t spot signs of it on tests) and relapse. Your doctor can help you understand what type you have.",,,,"There are lots of options if you have a relapse. The most common include: Chemotherapy. This medication kills cancer cells in your body. If your multiple myeloma comes back, you might get a higher dose or a different course of drugs, such as: Your doctor may also try high-dose steroids alone. Stem cell transplant. The high doses of chemo or radiation used to treat a multiple myeloma relapse can kill the stem cells in your bone marrow. To protect them, your doctor removes stem cells, usually from your hip. They’ll use a big needle to pull out the liquid marrow while you’re asleep. The cells are frozen and returned to your body by a vein after your treatment.Targeted therapies. These medications target specific parts of cells that help cancer cells grow, divide, or spread. The following drugs can be given alone or as part of a 3-drug combination treatment for recurrent multiple myeloma include:   About one-fourth of people with relapsed multiple myeloma will go into remission after several cycles of chemo. Those who get targeted therapies or high-dose chemo followed by a stem cell transplant usually have better outcomes. Clinical trial. You might want to consider this if your cancer comes back. These studies give you the chance to try new treatments that aren’t otherwise available. Supportive care. Your doctor may also offer this to ease your symptoms or manage complications."
Red Measles,https://www.webmd.com/children/vaccines/what-is-measles," Measles is an infection you get from a virus. The measles virus lives in the mucus of the nose and throat. It’s spread through the air and by coming into direct contact with someone who has it. The virus can stay active on surfaces and in the air for up to 2 hours. It’s very contagious. If you haven’t been vaccinated and are in a room with someone who has measles, you have a 90% chance of getting it. Part of what makes measles so dangerous is that you can be contagious 4 days before you get the telltale rash. So you could easily spread the virus without knowing you have it. You’ll continue to be contagious 4 days after the rash goes away.","Measles usually happens in stages over a period of about 2-3 weeks. For the first 10-14 days after you come into contact with the virus, you won’t have any signs. This is the incubation period.A high fever is normally the first sign of infection after the incubation period is over. The fever will last 4 to 7 days. During that time, you might have the following symptoms: Runny nose Red eyes Sore throat Tiny white bumps in your mouth (doctors call these Koplik spots)  After these symptoms, a red bumpy rash shows up. It usually starts at the hairline and spreads to the neck, torso, limbs, feet, and hands. As it spreads, your fever may spike as high as 105 F or higher. Finally, the rash starts to fade from the top of your body downward, starting with your face. You’re contagious to other people for 8 days: the 4 days before and after your rash shows up.","Measles spreads quickly and easily. You can get it from being close to someone who has it. It travels through coughs and sneezes. You’ll also get it if you come in contact with any other nose or mouth fluids from someone who has it.The virus can stay on surfaces for up to 2 hours. You can pick it up by touching the surface and then rubbing your nose or eyes or touching your mouth. Your risk of getting measles goes up if you: Aren’t vaccinated, especially if you’re young or pregnant Have traveled outside the country Live in an area where many people are unvaccinated Are low in vitamin A Have an immunodeficiency due to another condition or medical treatment","To figure out whether you have measles, your doctor will first look closely at your rash. They’ll also look for the small white Koplik spots inside your mouth. Sometimes, to confirm it, they can also do a blood test."," If you do get the measles virus, medicine won’t cure it (most drugs don’t kill viruses). The best way to speed up your recovery and prevent complications is to drink plenty of fluids and get lots of rest.There’s no specific treatment for measles, but there are things you can do if you think you’ve come into contact with it. Post-exposure vaccination. If you’ve never had a measles vaccination, you can get one up to 72 hours after being around the virus. The vaccine can lower your chances of getting it and can make your symptoms milder if you do. Immune serum globulin. This protein injection can boost your immune system if you’re pregnant, very young, or have a condition that makes it weak. You have to get it within 6 days of exposure to the virus. The injection may either prevent measles or keep your measles symptoms from being severe.  If your measles causes a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to help treat it. At home, you can help ease your measles symptoms with: Fever-reducing NSAIDs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Don’t give children aspirin Vitamin A. Kids with low levels of vitamin A are at higher risk of measles. Boosting it can make measles symptoms less severe. Rest Plenty of fluids to hydrate yourself after fever and sweats A humidifier for easier breathing Dim lights or sunglasses to relieve eye pain caused by bright lights"
Reducing Medical Costs,https://www.webmd.com/health-insurance/insurance-tips-for-er,"You might avoid a long wait and save a lot of money by going to an urgent care center instead of the ER. These centers can handle many illnesses and injuries that used to be treated only at an ER, such as: Save the ER for life-threatening conditions like seizures, serious head injuries, and severe pain, such as pain that could point to a heart attack or stroke, or concerning abdominal issues (ex: appendicitis). A few tips:  Many urgent care centers take insurance coverage. Ask if your plan is accepted. If you are taking your child to an ER or urgent care clinic, try to use a pediatric center or one where there are pediatricians on staff.",,,"You may need a lot of tests or imaging while you are in the ER to figure out what's causing your health problem. This is especially true when you have a medical emergency. But tests and imaging done in a hospital can cost a lot more than they would if done elsewhere. If you are able, ask your ER doctor if there's any risk in putting off tests and scans until you can see your primary care doctor, who might decide you don't need them. If you do need the tests but it's not an emergency, they'll likely cost less in a doctor's office than they will at the ER.",

Refractory Epilepsy,https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/refractory-epilepsy,"If your doctor says you have refractory epilepsy, it means that medicine isn't bringing your seizures under control. You might hear the condition called by some other names, such as uncontrolled, intractable, or drug-resistant epilepsy. Your doctor can try certain things to help keep your seizures under better control. For instance, they might try different combinations of drugs or a special diet. Your doctor may also put a device under your skin that sends electrical signals to one of your nerves, called the vagus nerve. This may cut the number of seizures you get. A Neuropace device is a reactive neurostimulator that detects seizures and shocks the brain to stop them. Surgery that removes a part of the brain that causes your seizures may also be an option. With any of these treatments, you may still need to take epilepsy medicine throughout your life. It's natural to feel anxious when the doctor tells you your epilepsy isn't getting better with the medicine you're taking. You don't have to go through it alone, though. It's important to reach out to family and friends to get the emotional support you need.

Rehabilitation for a Meniscus Tear,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/physical-therapy-meniscus-tear,"PT is often part of what doctors call “conservative treatment” to avoid surgery, at least early on. People who are middle-aged or have osteoarthritis often tear the meniscus simply because it’s worn down. For them, PT may be as effective as surgery.Even if you’re younger, fit, and athletic, a conservative approach is often a good place to start. It can work well, depending on the direction of the tear, how long it is, and where it’s located. But if the tear causes your knee to lock up, you’ll likely need surgery.  Part of your decision may be about how limited you are by the injury. If you’re an elite athlete or you can’t work because of it, you may not have time to see if a conservative approach works.

Rehabilitation for Multiple Sclerosis,https://www.webmd.com/multiple-sclerosis/features/ms-rehab-benefits,"MS causes muscle weakness, stiffness, numbness, and fatigue. Because these can make walking and exercise tough, people with MS are often inactive, which can make the symptoms worse. Physical therapy can bring about big improvements. Targeted exercise does the most good, says Herb Karpatkin, DSc. He’s a physical therapist who specializes in MS. “It’s not just exercise. It’s the right exercise for the right condition,” Karpatkin says. For example, if you have foot drop because of your MS, you need to do different exercises than someone who needs to work only on stamina walking. Your balance, endurance, strength, and flexibility can all get better with therapy. It can help even if you’re in a wheelchair. Because fatigue tends to be an issue, Karpatkin recommends you break up your exercise. For example, instead of 20 minutes of walking, walk for 5 minutes and rest, four times. You’re more likely to be heat sensitive if you have MS. Cooling garments can help. One study Karpatkin did showed a cooling vest allowed the same person to walk an average of an extra 100 feet during a 6-minute walk. It’s also important that you are assessed both when you’re tired and when you’re not. That way, your therapists get a true picture of what type of help will work best.",,,,

Rheumatic Chorea,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-rheumatic-fever-basics,"A rare but potentially life-threatening disease, rheumatic fever is a complication of untreated strep throat caused by bacteria called group A streptococcus. The main symptoms -- fever, muscle aches, swollen and painful joints, and in some cases, a red, lattice-like rash -- typically begin two to four weeks after a bout of strep. In some cases, though, the infection may have been too mild to have been recognized. The knees, ankles, elbows, and wrists are the joints most likely to become swollen from rheumatic fever. The pain often migrates from one joint to another. However, the greatest danger from the disease is the damage it can do to the heart. In more than half of all cases, rheumatic fever scars the valves of the heart, forcing this vital organ to work harder to pump blood. Over a period of months or even years -- particularly if the disease strikes again -- this damage to the heart can lead to a serious condition known as rheumatic heart disease, which can eventually cause the heart to fail.Rheumatic fever can also cause a temporary nervous system disorder once known as St. Vitus' dance, now known as Sydenham's chorea. This is a nervous disorder -- characterized by rapid, jerky, involuntary movements of the body, usually occurring more on one side of the body. People with mild cases of chorea may find it difficult to concentrate or write. More severe cases can cause the muscles of the arms, legs, or face to twitch uncontrollably. It can also be associated with muscle weakness and emotional outbursts. Because of antibiotics, rheumatic fever is now rare in developed countries. In recent years, though, it has begun to make a comeback in the U.S., particularly among children living in poor, inner-city neighborhoods. The disease tends to strike most often in cool, damp weather during the winter and early spring. In the U.S., it is most common in the northern states.",,"Rheumatic fever results from an inflammatory reaction to certain group A streptococcus bacteria. The body produces antibodies to fight the bacteria, but instead the antibodies attack a different target: the body's own tissues. The antibodies begin with the joints and often move on to the heart and surrounding tissues.

Rheumatic Purpura,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/henoch-schonlein-purpura-causes-symptoms-treatment,"The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved. An abnormal immune response to an infection may be a factor in many cases. Approximately two-thirds of the cases of HSP occur days after symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection develop. Some cases of HSP have been linked to vaccinations for typhoid, cholera, yellow fever, measles, or hepatitis B; foods, drugs, chemicals, and insect bites. Some experts also say that HSP is associated with the colder weather of fall and winter.","The classic symptoms of HSP are rash, joint pain and swelling, abdominal pain, and/or related kidney disease, including blood in urine. Before these symptoms begin, patients may have two to three weeks of fever, headache, and muscular aches and pains. Rarely, other organs, such as the brain, lungs, or spinal cord may be affected. Here are some key details about the symptoms of HSP:Rash. The rash usually appears in all patients with HSP. The initial appearance may resemble hives, with small red spots or bumps on the lower legs, buttocks, knees, and elbows. But these change to appear more like bruises. The rash usually affects both sides of the body equally and does not turn pale on pressing. Arthritis. Joint inflammation, involving pain and swelling, occurs in approximately three-quarters of cases, particularly affecting the knees and ankles. It usually lasts only a few days and does not cause any long-term, chronic joint problems. Abdominal pain. In more than half of people with HSP, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract may cause pain or cramping; it may also lead to loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and occasionally blood in the stool. In some cases, patients may have abdominal pain before the rash appears. In rare cases, an abnormal folding of the bowel (intussusception) may cause a bowel blockage, which may require surgery to fix. Kidney impairment. HSP can cause kidney problems, indicated by such signs as protein or blood in the urine. This is usually only discovered on urine testing, since it does not generally cause any discomfort. In most patients, the kidney impairment is mild and goes away without any long-term damage. It's important to monitor the kidney problems closely and make sure they clear up, since about 5% of patients may develop progressive kidney disease. About 1% may go on to develop total kidney failure.","The exact cause of HSP is not known. The body's immune system is believed to play a role in targeting the blood vessels involved.

A doctor may order some tests to rule out other diagnoses, confirm the diagnosis, and assess its severity. Occasionally, when the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if the only symptom is the classic rash, your doctor may perform biopsies of the skin or kidney. Urine and blood tests will likely be done to detect signs of kidney involvement and may need to be repeated during follow-up to monitor any changes in kidney function. Although there is no specific treatment for HSP, you can use over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen for joint pain. In some cases, corticosteroid medication may be used. The rash and joint pain will usually go away after four to six weeks without causing any permanent damage. Bouts of the rash may recur in approximately one-third of cases, but usually they are  milder, do not involve joint and abdominal symptoms, and they clear up on their own.Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is a disease involving inflammation of small blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in children. The inflammation causes blood vessels in the skin, intestines, kidneys, and joints to start leaking. The main symptom is a rash with numerous small bruises, which have a raised appearance, over the legs or buttocks. Although HSP can affect people at any age, most cases occur in children between the ages of 2 and 11. It is more common in boys than girls. Adults with HSP are more likely to have more severe disease compared to children. HSP usually ends after four to six weeks -- sometimes with recurrence of symptoms over this period, but with no long-term consequences (recurrences are fairly common). If organs such as the kidneys and intestines are affected, treatment is often needed and it is important to have regular follow-up to prevent serious complications.","The diagnosis of HSP may be clear when the typical rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain are present.

Restless legs syndrome affects up to 10% of people in the U.S. Anyone can get it, but it’s more common in women, and middle-aged people are more likely to have severe symptoms. Sometimes, doctors don’t recognize RLS, especially if symptoms are mild or don’t happen often. But once it’s diagnosed, treatment can often stop it.","People with restless legs syndrome have unusual feelings in their legs (like itching, crawling, pulling, aching, throbbing, or pins and needles) and a powerful urge to move their legs to make the sensations go away. The condition can also happen in other areas like the arms, chest, or head. The feelings usually happen on both sides of the body. They can also happen on only one side, or they might start on one side and then move to the other.RLS symptoms range from mild to unbearable. They might come and go, and the intensity can vary between episodes. They’re generally worse in the evening and at night. Symptoms almost always go away in the early morning, so people who have RLS can often sleep well then. The severity of RLS symptoms ranges from mild to intolerable. Symptoms can come and go and severity can also vary. The symptoms are generally worse in the evening and at night. For some people, symptoms may cause severe nightly sleep disruption that can significantly impair their quality of life.","Doctors don’t know what causes most cases of restless legs syndrome, but your genes might play a role. Nearly half of the people with RLS also have a family member with the condition. It might also be tied to:",There’s no medical test for RLS.

RP,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/what-is-retinitis-pigmentosa,"Retinitis pigmentosa usually starts in childhood. But exactly when it starts and how quickly it gets worse varies from person to person. Most people with RP lose much of their sight by early adulthood. Then by age 40, they are often legally blind.  Because rods are usually affected first, the first symptom you may notice is that it takes longer to adjust to darkness (called “night blindness). For example, you may notice it when you walk from bright sunshine into a dimly lit theater. You may trip over objects in the dark or not be able to drive at night. You may lose your peripheral vision at the same time or soon after your night vision declines. You may get ""tunnel vision,"" which means you can’t see things to the side without turning your head. In later stages, your cones may be affected. That will make it harder for you to do detail work, and you may have trouble seeing colors. It’s rare, but sometimes the cones die first.

Parents can pass the problem genes on to their children in three different ways: Autosomal recessive RP: Each parent has one problem copy and one normal copy of the gene that's responsible, but they don’t have any symptoms. A child that inherits two problem copies of the gene (one from each parent) will develop this type of retinitis pigmentosa. Since two copies of the problem gene are needed, each child in the family has a 25% chance of being affected. Autosomal dominant RP: This type of retinitis pigmentosa requires only one copy of the problem gene to develop. A parent with that gene has a 50% chance of passing it to each child. X-linked RP: A mother who carries the problem gene can pass it down to their children. Each one of them has a 50% chance of getting it. Most women who carry the gene won’t have any symptoms.

A few options can slow your vision loss and may even restore some sight:Other treatments under review include: Devices and tools can help you make the most of your vision, and rehab services can help you stay independent.Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a term for a group of eye diseases that can lead to loss of sight. What they have in common are specific changes your doctor sees when they look at your retina -- a bundle of tissue at the back of your eye. When you have RP, cells in the retina called photoreceptors don’t work the way they're supposed to, and over time, you lose your sight. It’s a rare disorder that’s passed from parent to child. Only 1 out of every 4,000 people get it. About half of all people with RP have a family member who also has it. The retina has two types of cells that gather light: rods and cones. The rods are around the outer ring of the retina and are active in dim light. Most forms of retinitis pigmentosa affect the rods first. Your night vision and your ability to see to the side -- peripheral vision -- go away. Cones are mostly in the center of your retina. They help you see color and fine detail. When RP affects them, you slowly lose your central vision and your ability to see color."

Later, it tells them to open back up so blood can get to damaged tissue and repair it.When you have RSD, your sympathetic nervous system gets mixed signals. It turns on after an injury, but doesn’t turn back off. This causes a lot of pain and swelling at your injury site.

You may also hear rubella called the “German measles” or the “three-day measles.” The best way to protect yourself and your children from infection is to get vaccinated with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.","Rubella is usually mild in children. Sometimes it doesn't cause any symptoms. A pink or red-spotted rash is often the first sign of infection. It starts on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. The rash lasts about 3 days. This is why rubella is sometimes called the ""3-day measles."" Along with the rash, you or your child might have:","Until the 1960s, rubella was a common childhood infection. Thanks to the MMR vaccine, the virus stopped spreading in the United States around 2004. Yet it still spreads in Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world.

If you haven’t been vaccinated and are in a room with someone who has measles, you have a 90% chance of getting it. Part of what makes measles so dangerous is that you can be contagious 4 days before you get the telltale rash. So you could easily spread the virus without knowing you have it. You’ll continue to be contagious 4 days after the rash goes away.","Measles usually happens in stages over a period of about 2-3 weeks. For the first 10-14 days after you come into contact with the virus, you won’t have any signs. This is the incubation period.A high fever is normally the first sign of infection after the incubation period is over. The fever will last 4 to 7 days. During that time, you might have the following symptoms: Runny nose Red eyes Sore throat Tiny white bumps in your mouth (doctors call these Koplik spots)  After these symptoms, a red bumpy rash shows up. It usually starts at the hairline and spreads to the neck, torso, limbs, feet, and hands. As it spreads, your fever may spike as high as 105 F or higher.

Post-exposure vaccination. If you’ve never had a measles vaccination, you can get one up to 72 hours after being around the virus. The vaccine can lower your chances of getting it and can make your symptoms milder if you do. Immune serum globulin. This protein injection can boost your immune system if you’re pregnant, very young, or have a condition that makes it weak. You have to get it within 6 days of exposure to the virus. The injection may either prevent measles or keep your measles symptoms from being severe.  If your measles causes a bacterial infection, such as an ear infection or pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antibiotic to help treat it. At home, you can help ease your measles symptoms with: Fever-reducing NSAIDs such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen. Don’t give children aspirin Vitamin A. Kids with low levels of vitamin A are at higher risk of measles. Boosting it can make measles symptoms less severe.

One minute you're sitting comfortably in front of the TV, and the next you try to stand up, and -- ouch! -- a sharp pain radiates through your lower back. Could you have a slipped or herniated disk? You might. The adult spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae. Some of the vertebrae are cushioned by soft disks made of a jellylike substance. These disks allow you to move your spine around and bend over. But if a disk between two vertebrae starts slipping out of place, it can irritate the surrounding nerves and cause extreme pain.

The pain may spread from your back to your buttocks, thighs, and even to your calves.Discomfort from a herniated disk usually gets worse when you're being active and lessens when you're resting. Even coughing, sneezing, and sitting can worsen your symptoms because they put pressure on pinched nerves. A herniated disk also can give you a feeling of tingling or numbness. The affected part of your back may also feel weak. Age also plays a role. As you get older, your disks tend to break down and lose their cushioning.

The notochord disappears before the baby is born.In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances.","Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is. Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like: Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like: Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus.","In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back.

These include: A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.","Your treatment will depend on:Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.  Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully."

SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder),https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder,"While we don't know the exact causes of SAD, some scientists think that certain hormones made deep in the brain trigger attitude-related changes at certain times of year. Experts believe that SAD may be related to these hormonal changes. One theory is that less sunlight during fall and winter leads to the brain making less serotonin, a chemical linked to brain pathways that regulate mood. When nerve cell pathways in the brain that regulate mood don't work the way they should, the result can be feelings of depression, along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain.SAD usually starts in young adulthood and is more common in women than men. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or cranky. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work.

The type of treatment you get also depends on whether you have another type of depression or bipolar disorder. Traditional antidepressants are often used to treat seasonal depression. Bupropion XL is currently the only medication that is FDA-approved specifically to prevent major depressive episodes in people with SAD. Many doctors recommend that people with SAD get outside early in the morning to get more natural light. If this is impossible because of the dark winter months, antidepressant  medications or light therapy (phototherapy) may help. Low levels of vitamin D, caused by low dietary intake of the vitamin or not enough exposure to sunshine, have been found in people with SAD. However, it's unclear whether vitamin D supplementation can help to relieve SAD symptoms. Very little research has been done on dietary supplements other than vitamin D for SAD."

Safe Food Handling,https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/food-poisoning/food-poisoning-basics,"Many times, your doctor will diagnose food poisoning based simply on your symptoms. While the main symptoms are nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach cramps, you also may have a fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, or blood in your stool. You may also be dehydrated, so your mouth and throat feel dry and you don’t pee as often as you typically do. Dehydration can make you dizzy when you stand up. Rarely, food poisoning can cause blurry or double vision, tingling, or weakness.More than 250 bacteria, viruses, and parasites are known to cause food poisoning. They can exist in foods at any stage, such as when they're growing, packaged, shipped, stored, or cooked. Certain foods are more likely to harbor bad germs. These include raw eggs, unpasteurized milk and juice, soft cheeses, and raw or undercooked meat or seafood. Fresh produce is another risk. Foods made in bulk are problematic, too. A single bad egg could affect the whole batch of omelets in a buffet. You could make trouble for yourself by not washing the cutting board or your hands as you prepare different foods. Your chances of getting food poisoning are higher in the summer. In 90-degree heat, food can start to spoil within an hour. At a picnic or during a camping trip, you are more likely to eat undercooked grilled meats or to handle raw meat without access to soap and water. Bacteria can grow quickly inside tepid coolers. So if you're picnicking on a hot day, put leftovers back in with fresh ice.","In most cases, food poisoning usually shows up hours or days after you’ve eaten something that made you sick.  That can make it hard to know if it's food poisoning or something else. The delay also makes it tricky to trace the illness back to the specific food or drink.But different organisms work at different speeds. For example, Staphylococcus aureus can give you cramps, diarrhea, and nausea in as little as 30 minutes after you eat or drink. This bacterium grows in meats, eggs, and cream that haven’t been refrigerated properly. Another, far less common, cause of foodborne illness is the hepatitis A virus. It can lie in wait as long as 50 days before making itself known. You can get the virus through foods and drinks that have been in contact with sewage water. You’re more likely to get the virus when traveling in developing countries.",Some bacteria cause fewer cases of food poisoning but can make you very sick. They can even cause death. They include:,"If your illness is severe or complicated, your doctor may run some of the following tests.  Stool cultures are the most common lab test for food poisoning. Your doctor may order one if you have a fever, ntense stomach pain, or bloody diarrhea, or if there is an outbreak that is being tracked. They may also order one if you have symptoms that linger. A sample of your stool can help tell if your sickness is related to bacteria. It can even reveal the germ’s DNA “fingerprint” and which antibiotics will kill it. Viruses are more difficult to see in culture,  so if the specific virus needs to be identified, your doctor may order stool tests to look for the germ's DNA fingerprint.Microscopic exams of stool can identify parasites. Stool tests aren’t always accurate, and they can take several days to come back. Blood tests may be ordered if your doctor thinks the infection has spread into the blood. Blood tests can detect the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes and the hepatitis A virus. Specific blood tests can tell how sick you are by looking for inflammation and signs that you’re dehydrated.Stool or blood tests can check for toxins, such as for botulism, which can be deadly. Imaging tests such as MRIs and CT scans aren’t often used in food poisoning cases. But they can help rule out other causes for your symptoms.     ","Call 911 if you think the food poisoning may be from seafood or wild mushrooms, or if the person is severely dehydrated. First, control nausea and vomiting:It’s important to prevent dehydration: Call a doctor right away if symptoms last more than 3 days or you have:"

The following are some of the more common salivary gland problems: Salivary stones, or sialoliths. The most common cause of swollen salivary glands, salivary stones are buildups of crystallized saliva deposits. Sometimes salivary stones can block the flow of saliva. When saliva can't exit through the ducts, it backs up into the gland, causing pain and swelling. Pain is usually off and on, is felt in one gland, and gets progressively worse.

For stones and other blockages of the ducts, treatment often begins with measures such as manual removal of stones, warm compresses, or sour candies to increase the flow of saliva. If simple measures don't relieve the problem, surgery may be required to remove the blockage and/or the affected gland.Surgery is usually required to remove benign and malignant tumors. Some benign tumors are treated with radiation to keep them from coming back. Some cancerous tumors require radiation and chemotherapy. Surgery may also be needed to treat large cysts. Other problems may be treated with medications. For example, bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Medications can also be prescribed for dry mouth.Your salivary glands make as much as a quart of saliva each day. Saliva is important to lubricate your mouth, help with swallowing, protect your teeth against bacteria, and aid in the digestion of food. The three major pairs of salivary glands are: There are also several hundred minor salivary glands throughout the mouth and throat. Saliva drains into the mouth through small tubes called ducts.

Sarcoid of Boeck,https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-sarcoidosis-basics,"Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that can affect multiple organs -- eyes, joints, skin -- but lungs are involved in 95% of cases. The disease is characterized by the buildup of immune system cells in organs that form small clusters called granulomas, a type of inflammation of the involved tissues. While the disease can affect anybody, African-Americans have a lifetime risk of 2.4% for developing sarcoidosis, while whites have a risk of 0.85%. It occurs most commonly between the ages of 20 and 40, although it can occur in children, and there is a second peak, particularly in women, after age 50. Because the symptoms of sarcoidosis can be vague and may be mistaken for other diseases, it's difficult to estimate how common it is. In the U.S., an estimated 10 to 40 in 100,000 people have sarcoidosis.  Sarcoidosis is not cancer; nor is it contagious. Although it can occur in families, it is not inherited. Usually the disease is not disabling; most people with sarcoidosis live normal lives. In fact, in the majority of cases, the disease appears only briefly and disappears on its own. About 20% to 30% of people with sarcoidosis are left with some permanent lung damage, and in 10% to 15% of patients the disease is chronic. Although it is rare, death from sarcoidosis can occur if the disease causes serious damage to vital organs, such as the brain, lungs, or heart.",,"Researchers believe sarcoidosis is associated with an abnormal immune system response, but what triggers this response is not known.

SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome),https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-what-is-sars,"SARS first sprang to the world’s attention in early 2003, when more than 8,000 people got sick in an outbreak that spread to 26 countries. Nearly 800 people died. Doctors and scientists tracked the disease to southeastern China, near Hong Kong. From there, travelers soon carried SARS to other countries in Asia, such as Vietnam and Singapore, as well as Europe and Canada.  Public health officials around the world scrambled to contain the outbreak. We’ve had no reported cases since 2004.","The symptoms of SARS start off similar to the flu. They may include: About 1 in 5 people with SARS may also get diarrhea. But the symptoms can get worse fast. SARS causes a dry cough that shows up anywhere from 2 to 7 days into the illness. This cough can keep your body from getting enough oxygen, and more than 1 in 10 people with SARS will need a machine to help them breathe. SARS can lead to other health problems, including pneumonia, heart failure, and liver failure. People who are over 60 and have ongoing illnesses like diabetes or hepatitis are most likely to have these problems.","SARS is caused by a virus that takes over your body’s cells and uses them to make copies of itself. The SARS virus is from a group known as coronaviruses, which also cause the common cold. SARS can spread when people who have it cough or sneeze, spraying tiny droplets of liquid with the virus to other people within 2-3 feet. Other people may get the virus by touching something those droplets hit, then touching their nose, eyes, or mouth. People who live with or are in close contact with someone who has SARS are more likely to get it than someone who is just passing by or sharing a room with an infected person.","If you have symptoms like a high fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, you should see a doctor, especially if you’ve just come back from a trip overseas. If there has been a new outbreak of SARS, you should tell your doctor whether you have been to the area where the outbreak happened. And if you think you have been exposed to SARS, you should avoid public places and take other steps so you don’t pass it on to others.Doctors might also ask whether you work in a lab or a medical center where you might have been exposed to the virus or whether you have some connection to other people with serious respiratory infections like pneumonia. If your doctor suspects you have SARS, they can confirm it with lab tests and images from an X-ray or CT scan.","It will depend on how severe your case is. If your symptoms are mild, you may be allowed to recover at home. But if they get worse, you may have to go to a hospital for more treatment, like getting fluids or oxygen. No drugs work against the virus that causes SARS. But you may get antibiotics to fight off other infections while you recover."

Painful skin blisters are the main symptom. They can form anywhere on the skin. Sometimes they also form on the eyes, or in parts of the throat, stomach, or bladder. If these blisters become infected or scar the skin, they cause more problems.","Almost all types of epidermolysis bullosa run in families. If you inherited certain gene glitches from your parents, you will have it. There’s one exception. Epidermolysis bullosa aquisita is the only type that’s not inherited. It happens because of a problem in your immune system.","To confirm the condition, your doctor may take a small sample of skin and send it to a lab where experts will use a microscope to look at it.","There’s no cure for epidermolysis bullosa. But there are treatments for it. If you have a severe case, you’ll care for your skin much like someone who has a burn does. You’ll need to learn how to perform daily wound treatment and how to bandage and protect affected areas. Your doctor can also prescribe a medicine to help with pain relief. In some cases, you might need surgery. If you have blisters that have fused your fingers and toes together, your doctor can separate them. Or if your esophagus, the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach, becomes too scarred, you can get surgery to widen it to help you eat.  Some people with epidermolysis bullosa still find eating too painful. In that case, your doctor may suggest a feeding tube so food goes right into your stomach."
Scars,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/scars,"Scars form when the dermis (deep, thick layer of skin) is damaged. The body forms new collagen fibers (a naturally occurring protein in the body) to mend the damage, resulting in a scar. The new scar tissue will have a different texture and quality than the surrounding tissue. Scars form after a wound is completely healed. There are different kinds of scars. Most scars are flat and pale. However, in cases when the body produces too much collagen, scars can be raised. Raised scars are called hypertrophic scars or keloid scars. Both of these kinds of scars are more common in younger and dark-skinned people. Some scars can have a sunken or pitted appearance. This kind of scarring occurs when underlying structures supporting the skin (for example, fat or muscle) are lost. Some surgical scars have this appearance, as do some scars from acne. Scars also can appear as stretched skin. Such scars result when the skin stretches rapidly (for example, as in growth spurts or during pregnancy). In addition, this type of scar can occur when the skin is under tension (near a joint, for example) during the healing process.",,,,"Although scars cannot be completely removed, their appearance can be improved to some extent. Methods for improving the appearance of scars include:Scars are a natural part of the body's healing process. A scar results from the biologic process of wound repair in the skin and other tissues. Most wounds, except for very minor ones, result in some degree of scarring. Scars can result from accidents, diseases, skin conditions such as acne, or surgeries."
Schereshevkii-Turner Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-turner-syndrome,"Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that’s found only in girls. It can cause problems ranging from short height to heart defects. Sometimes, the symptoms are so mild that it doesn’t get diagnosed until a female is a teen or young adult. The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.","Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.","Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy. A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism. When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.X chromosome abnormalities. Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material. In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.","If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing.","Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant. And carrying a child can come with health risks. If you have Turner syndrome, you should discuss those issues with your doctor."
Secondary Psychosis,https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/what-is-psychosis,"Psychosis is a condition that affects the way your brain processes information. It causes you to lose touch with reality. You might see, hear, or believe things that aren’t real. Psychosis is a symptom, not an illness. It can be triggered by a mental illness, a physical injury or illness, substance abuse, or extreme stress or trauma. Psychotic disorders, like schizophrenia, involve psychosis that usually affects you for the first time in the late teen years or early adulthood. Young people are especially likely to get it, but doctors don’t know why. Even before what doctors call the first episode of psychosis (FEP), you may show slight changes in the way you act or think. This is called the prodromal period and could last days, weeks, months, or even years. Sometimes you can lose touch with reality even when you don’t have a primary psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. When this happens, it's called secondary psychosis. These episodes stem from something else, like drug use or a medical condition. Whatever the reason, they tend to disappear in a short time, and they often stay away if you treat the condition that caused them.",Psychosis doesn’t suddenly start. It usually follows this pattern:  ,"Doctors don’t know exactly what causes psychosis, but some known risk factors include: Psychosis can also be a symptom of a mental illness, like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Drugs   Both drugs that depress the nervous system, like cannabis (marijuana), and stimulant drugs, like cocaine and amphetamines, can affect your brain activity in dramatic ways, so that what seems real to you doesn't match with the world. Most of the time, this goes away when you stop use of the drug. But there’s a strong link between all these drugs and primary psychosis. More than 25% of those who are diagnosed with amphetamine-induced psychosis later have psychotic disorders. Cannabis is involved in roughly half of all cases.Studies suggest that these drugs may not so much cause psychosis as uncover the condition when it’s already present among people with psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenic disorders or a family history of psychosis. Drugs used to treat mental illness can lead to problems as well. Although it’s rare, if you've been taking an antipsychotic (such as chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, perphenazine, and others) for many months or years, you could develop a movement disorder call tardive dyskinesia because of the long-term effects of the medication on your brain. And if you stop taking an antipsychotic medicine, you may get supersensitivity psychosis. Doctors think it happens because ongoing use of this type of drug changes how your brain responds to the chemical dopamine. Some antipsychotic medications, like aripiprazole (Abilify), carry an increased risk of psychosis.","You can see a psychologist, psychiatrist, or a social worker. They’ll find out what might have caused your symptoms and look for related conditions. Doctors diagnose mental illnesses after ruling out other things that could be causing psychotic symptoms.","It’s important to get treated early, after the first episode of psychosis. That will help keep the symptoms from affecting your relationships, work, or school. It may also help you avoid more problems down the road.Your doctor may recommend coordinated specialty care (CSC). This is a team approach to treating schizophrenia when the first symptoms appear. It combines medicine and therapy with social services and work and education support. The family is involved as much as possible."
Severe Hearing Loss,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/severe-hearing-loss,"Severe hearing loss means you can hear some sounds, but very poorly. You may not be able to hear someone speaking, even if they are using a normal voice. You may be able to hear only very loud sounds. Hearing loss can happen in many different ways to people of all ages. It’s different for everyone. The key is to work with your health care team to find ways to help you make the most of the hearing you have. There are many treatments that can help you or your child enjoy life.","If your child has trouble hearing, you’ll probably notice it by the way they behave. Some signs include: If hearing loss is affecting you, you may notice that you have a hard time interacting with others because you can’t hear them. Signs include:","Babies can be born with severe hearing loss, and children and adults can get it at any point in their lives. It can happen suddenly or over many years, in one or both ears, and be brief or long-lasting. To understand how hearing loss happens, it helps to know how your ear works. Noise travels through the air as sound waves, which vibrate your eardrum and move three tiny bones inside your ear. That causes waves in the fluid that fills your inner ear. Those waves bend tiny hair cells, which are attached to nerves. They pass electrical signals to the main hearing nerve, called the auditory nerve, which leads to the brain.Your DNA has many genes that help build the structures involved in hearing. A problem with any of them can mean a baby is born without this sense. Over half of babies born with severe hearing loss, it’s because of a faulty gene. About 20% of babies born with it also have another genetic condition, like Down syndrome. Babies also can lose their hearing because of a problem in the womb. Pregnant women who take certain medicines, such as the cancer drug thalidomide or drugs for tuberculosis, may have a baby with severe hearing loss. It can also happen if a woman has certain infections, like cytomegalovirus. You also may lose your hearing as you get older. It can happen because of:","It’s important to diagnose severe hearing loss as early as possible, especially for children. In some states, laws require medical staff to screen newborns for hearing before they leave the hospital. If your baby doesn’t get a test, ask hospital staff where you can get one.There are two types of newborn hearing tests: If your child shows any symptoms of severe hearing loss as they get older, talk to your pediatrician. If you have trouble hearing, you can talk to your doctor. Testing is usually about the same for children and adults. Your doctor may refer you to a hearing specialist called an otolaryngologist or otologist. They’ll ask about your medical history and do a physical exam of your ears. They may ask you:","Treatment for severe hearing loss usually means using different technology to improve the hearing you have. There’s no single therapy that’s best for every person with the condition. Your doctor will recommend one based on how much hearing you’ve lost, how healthy you are, your lifestyle, and how your ears were damaged.Your treatment options include: Hearing aids. They make low sounds louder or easier to hear. Some may help cut background noise.  Some hearing aids fit inside the ears. They can be so small that other people may not notice them. Others have clips that fit over the top of the ears to hold them steady. You can take them out when it’s time to sleep, swim, or shower. Extended-wear hearing aids are made of soft material. An audiologist will place them in your or your child’s ears, and they can stay there for months. People who are active may wear them while playing sports. Additional reading: Can a deaf person hear with a hearing aid? Implants. Middle ear implants are devices that vibrate inside your ear. Your doctor will place them there for you. You can use them for long periods of time. Cochlear implants help people who have such severe hearing loss that hearing aids don’t help. They trigger the nerves inside the ears. They don’t cure hearing loss, but they can give children and adults the sensation of sound and improved word/speech recognition."
Shaken Baby Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/shaken-baby-syndrome,"Shaken baby syndrome is a serious brain injury that happens to a baby or young child when it’s shaken with force. The impact kills the baby’s brain cells and keeps oxygen from getting to their brain.  Shaken baby syndrome is a form of child abuse. When a baby is shaken hard by the shoulders, arms, or legs, it can cause learning disabilities, behavior disorders, vision problems or blindness, hearing and speech issues, seizures, cerebral palsy, serious brain injury, and permanent disability. In some cases, it can be fatal.","Being shaken affects babies in many different ways. Symptoms include:You may notice bruises on the arms or chest in the places the baby has been grabbed. Other physical signs include: Babies with shaken baby syndrome may also have symptoms you can't see, such as: In mild cases, behavior, health, or learning issues show up later on.","It takes infants a while to hold their heads up. That’s because their neck muscles start out weak and get stronger as they grow. The same goes for their brains, which still need time to develop. When a baby is shaken, its brain can bounce between the front and back of its skull. This causes it to bleed, bruise, and swell. It only takes a few seconds of aggressive shaking for this to happen.Risk factors that lead to shaken baby syndrome Babies bring a lot of joy, but there can also be moments of frustration if you feel like you can’t console their crying. Most caregivers handle those times just fine. But if those feelings boil over, it can cross a line. Certain things can increase your risk of crossing that line, including:","Because shaken baby syndrome can affect so many different parts of a child's health, there may be more than one doctor or specialist involved in the diagnosis. Depending on the child's level of injury, the tests may be done in doctor's offices or a pediatric intensive care unit. To check the brain, doctors may use a CT scan to look for injuries that need immediate attention. MRI scans also show doctors detailed areas of the brain. X-rays of other body parts, like the arms, legs, spine, and skull, show fractures and whether they were created by force or accident or a full body scan in babies known as a ""skeletal survey."" To check for eye injuries and bleeding, an eye specialist may do an eye exam. Some disorders can mimic the symptoms of shaken baby syndrome. To rule those out, doctors may order blood tests.","Treatment for shaken baby syndrome depends on the injury. Surgery may be needed in an emergency. Some children will need care for the rest of their lives. Shaken baby syndrome is 100% preventable. It starts with making sure all the baby's caregivers -- parents, grandparents, baby sitters, nannies, etc. -- understand two things: Sometimes you can stop the crying by rubbing the baby's back, singing, using “white noise” from an app or the sound of running water, taking a walk, or using a pacifier. Sometimes nothing seems to work. That’s when you especially need to manage your feelings.Have a plan in place. If you feel pushed beyond your limit, put the baby on their back in a safe place -- or inside your home in a car seat with the baby strapped in on the floor (never leave your little one alone in the car!) -- and step away for a moment. Call someone you trust -- even your neighbor -- who'll listen to your frustrations. As you talk, check on the baby every 5 or 10 minutes. You could also ask someone to watch your baby for half an hour while you take a walk and collect yourself. If you notice your caregiver or another parent struggling, be supportive and suggest a safe place they can take the baby when they need a break. Like babies, sometimes parents and caregivers just need to cry and be comforted. If you suspect someone of shaking a baby, call your local police or the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline at 800-4-A-Child (800-422-4453)."

Shock,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/hypovolemic-shock,"Hypovolemic shock is a dangerous condition that happens when you suddenly lose a lot of blood or fluids from your body. This drops your blood volume, the amount of blood circulating in your body. That’s why it’s also known as low-volume shock. Hypovolemic shock is a life-threatening emergency. Blood helps hold your body temperature steady, forms blood clots, and moves oxygen and nutrients to all of your cells. If your blood volume gets too low, your organs won't be able to keep working. The most common cause of hypovolemic shock is blood loss when a major blood vessel bursts or when you’re seriously injured. This is called hemorrhagic shock. You can also get it from heavy bleeding related to pregnancy, from burns, or even from severe vomiting and diarrhea.","How hypovolemic shock shows up can depend on a number of things, including:With an injury, the most obvious sign of hypovolemic shock is a lot of bleeding.

Sjogren's Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/sjogrens-syndrome,"Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune disease that causes your immune system to go haywire and attack healthy cells instead of invading bacteria or viruses. Your white blood cells, which normally protect you from germs, attack the glands that are in charge of making moisture. When that happens, they can't produce tears and saliva, so your eyes, mouth, and other parts of your body dry out. There are treatments that bring relief, though. It's natural to worry when you learn you've got a lifelong disease that will need regular care. Keep in mind that most people with Sjogren's stay healthy and don't have serious problems. You should be able to keep doing all the things you love to do without making many changes.","The symptoms of Sjogren's can be different from person to person. You may have just one or two, or you may have many. By far, the most common symptoms are: Dry mouth that may have a chalky feeling or feeling or feel like cotton  Dry eyes that may burn, itch, or feel gritty Dry throat, lips, or skin Dryness in your nose A change in taste or smell Swollen glands in your neck and face  Skin rashes and sensitivity to UV light Dry cough or shortness of breath Feeling tired Trouble concentrating or remembering things Headache Dryness in the vagina in women Swelling, pain, and stiffness in your joints  Heartburn, a sensation of burning that moves from your stomach to your chest Numbness or tingling in some parts of your body","Doctors don't know the exact cause. You may have genes that put you at risk. An infection with a bacteria or virus may be a trigger that sets the disease in motion.For example, let's say you have a defective gene that's linked to Sjogren's, and then you get an infection. Your immune system swings into action. White blood cells normally lead the attack against the germs. But because of your faulty gene, your white blood cells target healthy cells in the glands that make saliva and tears. There's no let-up in the fight, so your symptoms will keep going unless you get treatment. Some other things can make you more likely to have Sjogren’s, including: Age. Sjogren’s usually affects people over 40, but younger adults and children can get it, too. Gender. Women are 10 times more likely to have Sjogren’s than men. Other autoimmune issues. Nearly half of all people who have Sjogren’s also have another autoimmune condition, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.","Because so many people with Sjogren's also have another autoimmune disease, and Sjogren’s symptoms sometimes look a lot like some other diseases, like fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome, it can sometimes be hard for your doctor to give you a diagnosis.To get clues, your doctor will give you a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Do your eyes itch or burn often? Are you getting a lot of cavities in your teeth? Does your mouth get dry? How about your lips? Do you have stiff or painful joints? Your doctor may ask you to get some blood tests. They will take some blood from your vein and send it to a lab to get checked. The blood tests measure the levels of  the different types of blood cells you have and can show if you have germ-fighting proteins (antibodies) that many people with Sjogren's have. They can also measure inflammation in your body and the amount of certain proteins called immunoglobulins that are part of your body’s infection-fighting system. High levels of these can be signs that you have the disease. Your blood tests can also give your doctor an idea of how well your liver is working and show if there might be any issues with it. ","You'll need to take medicine throughout your life to help you manage your symptoms. You can buy some kinds in a drugstore without a prescription, while your doctor may need to prescribe stronger ones if those don’t work well enough. For instance, drops called ""artificial tears"" can keep your eyes from drying out. You'll need to use them regularly throughout the day. There are also gels that you put on your eyes at night. The advantage of the gels is that they stick to your eye's surface, so you won't need to apply them as often as the drops. If artificial tears aren't helping, your doctor may prescribe drugs for your dry eyes, including: Cequa Lacrisert RestasisLacrisert is a tiny rod-shaped medicine. You put it into your eye with a special applicator, usually once or twice a day. Cequa and Restasis come in drops, which you use twice a day. Another treatment option for dry eyes is a procedure called punctal occlusion. This is when your doctor puts tiny plugs into your tear ducts to block them up. This keeps tears from draining away too fast, meaning they stay on your eyes longer and help your eyes stay moist.  To help your dry mouth, your doctor may prescribe drugs that boost the amount of your saliva, including: Cevimeline (Evoxac) Supersaturated calcium phosphate rinse (NeutraSal) Pilocarpine (Salagen) There are other treatments for some of the less common symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome. For instance, if you get yeast infections in your mouth, your doctor might prescribe antifungal medicine. If you get heartburn, your doctor may give you medicines that curb the amount of acid in your stomach. Your doctor may also suggest a medicine called hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) to treat your joint pain. It's a drug that's also used to treat malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. It's rare, but some people with Sjogren's get symptoms throughout the body, including belly pain, fever, rashes, or lung and kidney problems. For those situations, doctors sometimes prescribe prednisone (a steroid) or an anti-inflammation drug called methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall)."

Melanoma that has spread to other organs presents the greatest treatment challenge. Standard treatments for localized basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas are safe and effective. Small tumors can be surgically excised, removed with a scraping tool (curette) and then cauterized, frozen with liquid nitrogen, or killed with low-dose radiation. Applying an ointment containing a chemotherapeutic agent called 5-fluorouracil -- or an immune response modifier called imiquimod -- to a superficial tumor for several weeks may also work. Larger localized tumors are removed surgically. In rare cases where basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma has begun to spread beyond the skin, tumors are removed surgically and patients are treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Sometimes disfiguring or metastatic (spreading) basal cell skin cancers that are not able to be treated by surgery or radiation are treated orally with sonidegib (Odomzo) or vismodegib (Everidge). Melanoma tumors must be removed surgically, preferably before they spread beyond the skin into other organs. The surgeon removes the tumor fully, along with a safe margin of surrounding tissue.

Skull Base Chordoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-chordoma,"In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born.In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances.","Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is. Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like: Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like: Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine.

These include: A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.","Your treatment will depend on:Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.  Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully."
Sleep Epilepsy,https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/guide/narcolepsy,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder that affects your ability to wake and sleep. People with narcolepsy have excessive, uncontrollable daytime sleepiness. They may also suddenly fall asleep at any time, during any type of activity. In a typical sleep cycle, we enter the early stages of sleep, then the deeper stages, and finally (after about 90 minutes) rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. People with narcolepsy go into REM sleep almost immediately in the sleep cycle and sometimes while they’re awake. Type 1 narcolepsy comes with a sudden loss of muscle tone that causes weakness and makes you unable to control your muscles (cataplexy). Type 2 is narcolepsy without cataplexy. In many cases, narcolepsy isn’t diagnosed and therefore isn’t treated..","In REM sleep, we can dream and have muscle paralysis, which explains some of the symptoms of narcolepsy. Those symptoms may include:","Experts don’t know what causes narcolepsy. They think it involves multiple things that come together to cause problems in your brain and disturb your REM sleep.Scientists are getting closer to finding genes linked to the disorder. These genes control the production of chemicals in your brain that may signal sleep and awake cycles. Some experts think narcolepsy may happen because your brain has a hard time making a chemical called hypocretin. They’ve also found problems in parts of the brain involved in controlling REM sleep. Risk factors for narcolepsy include your age. Narcolepsy usually begins between the ages of 15 and 25, but it can show up at any age. If you have a family history of narcolepsy, your risk of getting it is 20 to 40 times higher.",Symptoms of narcolepsy can look like those of other health problems. Your diagnosis might involve:,There’s no cure for narcolepsy. But treatments that can help ease your symptoms include:
Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/hip-impingement-causes-treatments,"You can have hip impingement for years and not know it, because it is often not painful in its early stages. When hip impingement causes symptoms, it may be referred to as hip impingement syndrome. The main symptoms are  ""pain"" in the groin, especially when walking or flexing the hip, and decreased range of motion in the hip.  At first, you may only feel pain when you move the hip near its limits. As the condition progresses, however, you may feel pain with more subtle activities, such as sitting for a long time or walking up a hill. Pain that occurs at night or when walking on flat ground suggests that the cartilage cushioning the ball and socket has begun to break down and wear away, a condition known as osteoarthritis.","You can have hip impingement for years and not know it, because it is often not painful in its early stages.

Pain that occurs at night or when walking on flat ground suggests that the cartilage cushioning the ball and socket has begun to break down and wear away, a condition known as osteoarthritis.","There are two main causes of hip impingement: A deformity of the ball at the top of the femur (called cam impingement). If the head is not shaped normally, the abnormal part of the head can jam in the socket when the hip is bent. This may occur during activities such as riding a bicycle or tying your shoes. A deformity of the socket (pincer impingement). If the front rim of the socket (called the acetabulum) sticks out too far, the area of the thigh bone (femur) just below the ball, called the neck of the femur, may bump into the rim of the socket during normal hip flexion movement. In some cases, there is a problem with both the ball and the socket. Other problems that can cause hip impingement include conditions such as:  ","If you have symptoms of hip impingement, your doctor can diagnose the problem based on your description of your symptoms, a physical exam, and the findings of imaging tests. These tests may include one or more of the following:","Treatment for hip impingement should begin with: If these treatments do not relieve pain, your doctor may recommend hip impingement surgery. The type of surgery needed will depend on the problem causing hip impingement and how much cartilage damage has occurred. Often, surgery for hip impingement can be performed arthroscopically. This technique involves inserting a lighted scope and thin tools through small incisions over your hip instead of making a large incision. Arthroscopy is usually an outpatient surgery. This means you can go home the same day. The earlier you have surgery, the greater your chances of a complete recovery. But even if cartilage has been damaged, surgery may still reduce pain and improve range of motion.If cartilage damage is severe, however, hip replacement may be the only treatment that will relieve pain and improve function. However, there are promising experimental treatments, including one in which parts of your own blood are injected into joints to stimulate cartilage growth.Your hip is the joint where your thigh bone meets your pelvis. It is called a ball-and-socket joint, because the ball-like top of your thigh bone fits into a cup-like area within your pelvis, much like a baseball fits into a glove.   Normally, the ball glides smoothly within the socket, but a problem with the ball or socket rim can interfere with smooth motion, leading  to hip impingement or femoro acetabular impingement (FAI). It is believed to be a major cause of early osteoarthritis of the hip, particularly in those under age 40."
Slipped Disc,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/do-i-have-a-herniated-disk,"Back pain can sneak up on you when you least expect it. One minute you're sitting comfortably in front of the TV, and the next you try to stand up, and -- ouch! -- a sharp pain radiates through your lower back. Could you have a slipped or herniated disk? You might. The adult spine is made up of 24 bones called vertebrae. Some of the vertebrae are cushioned by soft disks made of a jellylike substance. These disks allow you to move your spine around and bend over. But if a disk between two vertebrae starts slipping out of place, it can irritate the surrounding nerves and cause extreme pain. The condition is called a slipped, ruptured, or herniated disk.","One sign may be where the pain is. Although herniated disks can happen in any part of your spine, they are most common in the lower part of your backbone (the lumbar spine), just above your hips. The pain may spread from your back to your buttocks, thighs, and even to your calves.Discomfort from a herniated disk usually gets worse when you're being active and lessens when you're resting. Even coughing, sneezing, and sitting can worsen your symptoms because they put pressure on pinched nerves. A herniated disk also can give you a feeling of tingling or numbness. The affected part of your back may also feel weak. Age also plays a role. As you get older, your disks tend to break down and lose their cushioning. That makes a herniated disk more likely.",,"The best way to tell if you have a herniated disk is to see your doctor. They’ll likely do a physical exam to find the source of your pain. This usually is the only test you’ll need to confirm a diagnosis. Your doctor will check your back for sore or painful spots. They may ask you to lie on your back and lift or move your legs in certain ways. If you feel pain, it’s likely a herniated disk.They may also check: If your doctor wants to rule out other sources of your pain, or pinpoint specific nerves that are aggravated, they may do further testing, including: ",
Slow Heart Rate (Bradycardia),https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/bradycardia,"Electrical signals travel through the heart’s four chambers -- two on the top called the atria and below them, the two ventricles. These signals prompt it to beat in a steady rhythm. But pulses don’t always fire off as they should. This creates what’s called arrhythmias, or abnormal heartbeats.Some conditions cause the heart to beat too fast or to flutter. With bradycardia, it’s the opposite. The electrical problem slows down the time in between heartbeats.  You may simply have a slower-than-normal heart rate that doesn’t cause any symptoms. The electrical activity may be working fine, just a little slower than it does in most people. You wouldn’t even be diagnosed with this condition. And even with bradycardia, you may never notice any symptoms or need treatment. But that’s not always the case.","The biggest concern is your heart isn’t doing well enough at pumping blood to all the organs and tissues that need it. When this happens, the following may develop: You may also find that you tire out easily with even just a little activity. If you check your heart rate and it’s regularly below 60 beats per minute, be aware of those symptoms. If you have no other symptoms, you probably don’t need to see a doctor right away. You may exercise a lot, and a slow heart rate could be a sign of how fit you are. But, bring it up at your next appointment.","The chances of getting bradycardia increase as you get older, though that’s true of most heart conditions. The causes of bradycardia can vary greatly from one person to the next. The abnormal rhythm can show up after a heart attack or as a side effect of heart surgery. Other things that can lead to it:","Bradycardia can be a little hard for doctors to figure out, because it’s not always present all the time. Your heart can go in and out of slow rhythms. Your doctor will be able to make the diagnosis if you’re having a bout of bradycardia during a test called an electrocardiogram. Often called an EKG, it’s a way to measure your heart’s electrical system. If your heart rate appears normal, but you have had symptoms of bradycardia, your doctor may have you wear a 24-hour monitor. Your doctor will ask about your personal and family health histories, as well as any symptoms you’ve had.","If your doctor decides that you have bradycardia, the treatment plan will be based on the likely cause of the problem. For instance, if the cause is hypothyroidism, or low thyroid function, treating that may take care of the heart rate issue. If there is no clear physical cause, your doctor may change medications that might be slowing your heart. Beta blockers are sometimes prescribed to relax your heart muscle. But if they cause you to have a really slow heart rate, your doctor might lower the dosage or give you a different drug.If these approaches don’t work and your condition is serious enough to put your brain and other organs at risk, you may need a pacemaker. A surgeon will put this small device into your chest. It has thin, flexible wires, called leads, which extend to the heart. They carry small electrical charges that help keep the heart pumping at a steady rate. If you have been given a pacemaker, listen to your doctor’s instructions about how it operates and any signs it might not be working.Generally, it is normal to have a slower heart rate when you’re resting. It can be a sign of good health. But if it’s too slow, it could be a symptom of a condition called bradycardia. Normally, your heart beats 60 to 100 times a minute when you’re at rest. But with bradycardia, it goes down to less than 60 beats a minute. This might not cause a problem for some people. But it could be a clue that you have an issue with the electrical system in your heart. You need to see a doctor who can figure out why it’s beating slowly and if you should get treatment."
Small Bowel Obstruction,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/what-is-bowel-obstruction,"A bowel obstruction is a serious problem that happens when something blocks your bowels, either your large or small intestine. It’s also known as an intestinal obstruction. If your digestive system comes to a grinding halt, you can’t have a bowel movement or pass gas. You might also notice stomach pain and a swollen belly. A common type of blockage is called fecal impaction. This is when a large, hard mass of poop gets stuck in your digestive tract and can’t get pushed out the usual way. But when your bowel is blocked by something other than hard stool, doctors call it a bowel obstruction.","Signs of an intestinal blockage will depend on how severe the obstruction is. But it almost always comes with belly pain, usually around your belly button, and cramping. Other signs include: If you’ve been constipated and have any of these symptoms, contact your doctor right away. They’ll let you know what to do, including whether to call 911. Many people with bowel obstructions are older and may have other serious illnesses, so a bowel obstruction may be life-threatening. You’ll most likely need to go to the hospital for treatment.","Your bowel could become blocked in several ways:In many cases, inflammation, surgeries, or cancer can cause a bowel obstruction. It’s more likely to happen in older people. Bowel obstructions can happen in your small or large intestine, but they’re more likely to be in the small intestine. You might be at higher risk if you have:","Your doctor will ask about your medical history, including whether you’ve been constipated, if you’ve had cancer, and what new symptoms you’ve had. They also may:","You’ll probably need to go to the hospital for treatment. Your doctor will give you medicine and fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV). They may also run a thin tube through your nose and into your stomach. This is called a nasogastric (NG) tube. It lets out fluids and gas to ease your symptoms. Most partial blockages get better on their own. Your doctor may give you a special diet that’s easier on your intestines. Enemas of air or fluid can help clear blockages by raising the pressure inside your bowels. A mesh tube called a stent is a safe option for people who are too sick for surgery. Your doctor puts it in your intestine to force the bowel open. Some people may not need anything more than a stent. Others may need surgery after they become stable.Surgery is usually the best treatment for a totally blocked intestine when your bowel is damaged. Your doctor can treat the cause of the obstruction or take out the blocked area and any damaged tissue. If you have surgery, you may need a colostomy or ileostomy. After your doctor takes out the damaged part of your intestine, they sew the rest to an opening in your skin. Poop exits your body through this opening and goes into a disposable bag. In some cases, your intestines can be reattached after you get better."

But they do know that several things can increase your chances of getting the disease:,"Your doctor will do a thorough medical exam. They’ll ask about your medical history and any problems you may be having.They’ll likely order imaging tests. These create pictures of your small bowel so they can see if there’s cancer and whether it has spread. Tests might include X-rays, a CT scan, or MRI. They might also order an endoscopy. That’s a procedure where your doctor looks at the inside of your esophagus, stomach, and first part of your small intestine. To do this, they’ll use an endoscope -- a thin, tubelike instrument that has a light and camera at the end of it. You’ll be given medication to sedate you for the procedure. Other tests your doctor might order include the following:","Which treatment your doctor recommends will depend on a number of things, like what type of cancer it is and whether it has spread. Surgery is the most common treatment. Your surgeon may remove the part of the small intestine that contains cancer. Or they may do “bypass” surgery so that food can go around a tumor that can’t be removed. Even if your doctor takes out all of the cancer during surgery, they may still suggest radiation therapy. This uses high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells. They might also offer chemotherapy (chemo). These are drugs you take by mouth or through an IV tube. They, too, kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. A number of new therapies are being tested, as well. Talk to your doctor if you’re interested in taking part in one of these clinical trials before, during, or after your treatment.Small intestine cancer is a rare disease where cells in the tissue of the small intestine change. They grow out of control and can form a mass, or tumor. The small intestine (also called “small bowel”) connects your stomach to your large intestine. Its main job is to break down and absorb food, fats, vitamins, and other substances your body needs. If you have this type of cancer, tumor cells may block the small intestine. There are five types of small intestine cancer:"
Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/small-lymphocytic-lymphoma-cancer,"Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) is a cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called a ""lymphocyte,"" which helps your body fight infection. You may hear your doctor refer to SLL as a ""non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"" which is a group of cancers that affect lymphocytes. When you have SLL, too many ineffective lymphocytes live and multiply in your lymph nodes. These are pea-sized organs in your neck, groin, armpits, and elsewhere, that are part of your immune system. SLL tends to grow slowly. You may not have any symptoms when you're first diagnosed. A lot of people find out they have SLL when it's detected after a blood test for another reason. If you're not having symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. Instead, your doctor will watch your health regularly and won't suggest therapy until you need it. For some people, treatment knocks out the cancer for good, or keeps it from coming back for a long time. It's normal to have worries and questions about any serious condition. Learn about your treatment options, and seek out family and friends for support. They can help you get through the emotional and physical challenges ahead.","You might not have any obvious symptoms when you're diagnosed with SLL. The disease might be found during a routine blood test. About one-third of all people with SLL live for years without having symptoms. When symptoms appear, they may include:","You can't ""catch"" SLL like you do a cold or infection. It's also not passed on from parents to children. Doctors don't know exactly what causes it. They do know, though, that the disease is rare in people under 50. The average age that people get diagnosed with the disease is 65. And it affects men more than women. A few things are linked to a higher risk of getting SLL:","Your doctor will do a physical exam and may ask you questions such as: Your doctor may also ask you to get a lymph node biopsy. This is the main test to diagnose SLL. Your doctor removes the lymph node and checks it under a microscope for signs of cancer. Many lymph nodes are near the surface of your skin. If that's the case, your doctor will give you a shot that numbs your skin. Then they'll make a cut and remove the lymph node. You can usually go home the same day. You'll have a small wound with a few stitches that can be removed in about a week. Your doctor may also do two bone marrow tests -- a bone marrow aspiration and a biopsy -- to find out how advanced your cancer is. They are usually done together as part of a single procedure that removes marrow from the back of your hip bone.For a bone marrow aspiration, your doctor first numbs the skin over your hip and the surface of the bone. They then inserts a thin needle into the bone and uses a syringe to suck out a small amount of liquid bone marrow. Usually the doctor does the bone marrow biopsy next. They remove a small piece of bone and marrow with a slightly larger needle.","If you have no symptoms, your doctor might recommend ""watchful waiting."" During this period, they'll monitor you and start treatment if the disease starts to get worse. If you need treatment, you have several options: Chemotherapy. You can get various chemotherapy drugs that kill your cancer cells. The medicine comes in pill form or may be given through an IV. You may be treated with one drug or a combination.Chemotherapy is a key treatment for SLL and can often put the disease in remission, which means you no longer have any signs of cancer, although it can return. Monoclonal antibody therapy. These are drugs that act like man-made antibodies that specifically target cancer cells. They help your immune system destroy them. Among those available are: You get them through an IV. Radiation therapy. This uses high energy X-rays to kill cancer cells in one or two groups of lymph nodes in the same part of the body. It may be useful if you're in the earlier stages of SLL and the disease hasn't spread. Targeted therapy. These drugs attack one or more specific targets on cancer cells. Your doctor might suggest them if you've already had another treatment that didn't work. Examples taken orally include:"
Smallpox,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/smallpox-causes-treatment,"Smallpox is a contagious disease caused by a virus that’s no longer found in nature.For centuries, smallpox killed millions of people around the world. But thanks to global immunization programs, the deadly infectious disease was wiped out in the late 1970s. Today, scientists keep only a small amount of the virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in the U.S. and in many other countries in 1972, and in all other World Health Organization member countries by 1986. Many adults living today likely got the vaccine as children.","Smallpox gets its name from its most common sign of the disease: small blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus. Other symptoms include:","Some of its side effects can be dangerous, especially for people with weak immune systems. They can range from skin reactions to a serious nervous system condition called encephalitis, which can lead to convulsions, coma, and death. But these side effects are very rare. Based on historical data, for every 1 million people vaccinated for smallpox, one to two people died from a bad reaction. Some people would have a higher risk of a reaction to the vaccine, like:  ","Because smallpox hasn’t been diagnosed in decades, it’s likely that doctors wouldn’t recognize the disease in patients right away. It’s possible to diagnose the condition by testing a sample of tissue taken from a smallpox blister. A single diagnosis would be considered a worldwide health emergency.","There’s only one known drug that can treat smallpox. The drug tecovirimat (TPOXX) was approved in 2018 for the treatment of smallpox should someone show symptoms of the virus. The drug cidofovir has also worked well in early studies. Getting the vaccine within 3 to 4 days of contact with the virus may make the disease less severe or may help prevent it. Beyond that, medical care aims to ease symptoms like fever and body aches, and control any other illnesses that a person can get when their immune system is weak. Antibiotics can help if someone gets a bacterial infection while they have smallpox."
Snoring,https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/snoring,"Snoring is noisy breathing while you sleep. It’s a common condition that can affect anyone, although it happens more often in men and in people who are overweight. Snoring tends to get worse with age. Snoring once in a while isn’t usually a serious problem. It’s mostly a nuisance for your bed partner. But if you’re a long-term snorer, you not only disrupt the sleep patterns of those close to you, you hurt your own sleep quality. Snoring can itself be a symptom of a health problem like obstructive sleep apnea. Talk to your doctor if you’re overly sleepy during the day, if you snore often or very loudly, or if your partner notices that you sometimes stop breathing altogether. You might need medical help so you (and your loved ones) can get a good night’s sleep.",,"Snoring happens when the flow of air through your mouth and nose is blocked. Several things can interfere with air flow, including:","Your partner might be the person who tells you that you snore. Your doctor will ask both of you about your symptoms.Your doctor will also ask about your medical history and do a physical exam to look for things that could block your airways, like chronic nasal congestion due to rhinitis or sinusitis, a deviated septum, or swollen tonsils.

Social Anxiety Disorder,https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/mental-health-social-anxiety-disorder,"In some people with social anxiety disorder, the fear is limited to one or two particular situations, like speaking in public or initiating a conversation. Others are very anxious and afraid of any social situation. Anyone with social anxiety disorder can experience it in different ways. But here are some common situations that people tend to have trouble with: Some of these situations might not cause a problem for you. For example, giving a speech may be easy, but going to a party might be a nightmare. Or you could be great at one-on-one conversations but not at stepping into a crowded classroom. All socially anxious people have different reasons for dreading certain situations. But in general, it’s an overwhelming fear of:",,"There’s no one thing that causes social anxiety disorder. Genetics likely has something to do with it: If you have a family member with social phobia, you’re more at risk of having it, too. It could also be linked to having an overactive amygdala -- the part of the brain that controls your fear response. Social anxiety disorder usually comes on around 13 years of age. It can be linked to a history of abuse, bullying, or teasing. Shy kids are also more likely to become socially anxious adults, as are children with overbearing or controlling parents. If you develop a health condition that draws attention to your appearance or voice, that could trigger social anxiety, too.",,"Prescription medication and behavioral therapy are the two effective treatments for social anxiety disorder. You may receive both at the same time. Here are some details on each:Medications: For some, taking a prescription medication can be an easy and effective treatment for social anxiety disorder. The drugs work by reducing the uncomfortable and often embarrassing symptoms. Sometimes medication can dramatically reduce your symptoms or even eliminate them. Some people may not react to a particular medication, and some aren't helped at all. There is no way to predict whether a medication will help you or not. Sometimes, you must try several before finding one that works. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four medicines for social anxiety disorder: Paxil, Zoloft, Luvox, and Effexor. Although these are the only medications approved specifically for the condition, other medications may be used successfully, too. The advantage of medications is that they can be very effective, and are taken just once a day. But there are some downsides. First, medication only treats symptoms. If you stop taking it, your symptoms can return. Second, some people have side effects from anxiety medications. They may include headache, stomachache, nausea, and sleep difficulties."
Soft Tissue Sarcoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/sarcoma,"We don't yet know what causes sarcoma, but we do know some things that raise the risk of developing one: ","Soft tissue sarcomas are hard to spot, because they can grow anywhere in your body. Most often, the first sign is a painless lump. As the lump gets bigger, it might press against nerves or muscles and make you uncomfortable or give you trouble breathing, or both. There are no tests that can find these tumors before they cause symptoms that you notice. Osteosarcoma can show obvious early symptoms, including: Children and young adults get osteosarcoma more often than adults. And because healthy, active children and teens often have pain and swelling in their arms and legs, osteosarcoma might be mistaken for growing pains or a sports injury. If your child's pain doesn't get better, gets worse at night, and is in one arm or leg rather than both, talk to a doctor. Adults who have this kind of pain should see a doctor right away.","We don't yet know what causes sarcoma, but we do know some things that raise the risk of developing one: ",,"How your sarcoma is treated depends on what type you have, where in your body it is, how developed it is, and whether or not it has spread to other parts of your body, or metastasized. Surgery takes the tumor out of your body. In most cases of osteosarcoma, the doctor can remove just the cancer cells, and you won't need your arm or leg removed, too. Radiation can shrink the tumor before surgery or kill cancer cells that are left after surgery. It could be the main treatment, if surgery isn't an option. Chemotherapydrugs can also be used with or instead of surgery. Chemo is often the first treatment when the cancer has spread. Targeted therapies are newer treatments that use drugs or manmade versions of antibodies from the immune system to block the growth of cancer cells while leaving normal cells undamaged."
Spasmodic Torticollis,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-torticollis,"You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM. When your baby has torticollis, this ropy muscle is shortened on one side. Why does the muscle become shortened? Your baby might have been cramped in the womb or may have been in an abnormal position, such as a breech position. That can put extra pressure on one side of your infant’s head, which can cause the SCM to tighten. If your doctor used forceps or a vacuum device during delivery, those also might have put pressure on your baby’s SCM.",You may not notice anything unusual about your baby for the first 6 or 8 weeks. It’s common for torticollis symptoms to become obvious once an infant gains more control of the head and neck. Some of the symptoms you might see:,"You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM.

Once torticollis is diagnosed and stretching exercises start, most babies improve within 6 months. Two things can speed recovery: an early diagnosis and sticking to the treatment plan. Very rarely, children with torticollis will need surgery to lengthen the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Doctors will usually wait until your child is a preschooler to consider this option.Torticollis is a problem involving the muscles of the neck that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck. Sometimes it’s called “wryneck.” If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis. That’s the most common type. Babies can also develop the condition after birth. Then it’s called “acquired,” rather than congenital. Acquired torticollis may be linked to other, more serious medical issues."
Spastic Colon,https://www.webmd.com/ibs/guide/digestive-diseases-irritable-bowel-syndrome,"IBS is a mix of belly discomfort or pain and trouble with bowel habits: either going more or less often than normal (diarrhea or constipation) or having a different kind of stool (thin, hard, or soft and liquid). Doctors used to call IBS other names including: There are four types of the condition: IBS isn’t life-threatening, and it doesn't make you more likely to get other colon conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or colon cancer. But it can be a long-lasting problem that changes how you live your life. People with IBS may miss work or school more often, and they may feel less able to take part in daily activities. Some people may need to change their work setting: shifting to working at home, changing hours, or even not working at all.","People with IBS have symptoms that can include: Other things may cause these symptoms sometimes. If it’s IBS, you’ll likely have these symptoms weekly for 3 months, or less often for at least 6 months. Women with IBS may have more symptoms during their period. Some people also have urinary symptoms or sexual problems. Stress can make symptoms worse. When to call your doctor  If you have an IBS symptom that lasts a long time, you get a new symptom, or your pain is worse than usual or you have new pain, see your doctor. If you usually take over-the-counter medications but now they don’t ease problems like diarrhea, gas, or cramping, you also need to see a doctor.Even if you don’t think a problem is physically part of IBS, but it bothers you, tell your doctor. For example, if you’re stressed out or anxious about it, or if you’re losing sleep over the problem, let your doctor know. IBS usually doesn’t lead to more serious diseases, but there are “red flags” to look for that could mean something more serious is going on. A red-flag symptom is one that isn’t usually seen with IBS. If you have one or more, see your doctor. You’ll need tests to find out what’s going on. Red-flag symptoms include:","While several things are known to trigger IBS symptoms, experts don't know what causes the condition. Studies suggest that the colon gets hypersensitive, overreacting to mild stimulation. Instead of slow, rhythmic muscle movements, the bowel muscles spasm. That can cause diarrhea or constipation. Another theory suggests it may involve chemicals made by the body, such as serotonin and gastrin, that control nerve signals between the brain and digestive tract. Other researchers are studying to see if certain bacteria in the bowels can lead to the condition. IBS affects between 25 million and 45 million Americans. Some things seem to make people more likely to have it than others:","There are no specific lab tests that can diagnose IBS. Your doctor will see if your symptoms match with the definition of IBS, and they may run tests to rule out conditions such as: Your doctor may do some of the following tests to decide if you have IBS:","Nearly all people with IBS can get help, but no single treatment works for everyone. You and your doctor will need to work together to find the right treatment plan to manage your symptoms. Many things can trigger IBS symptoms, including certain foods, medicines, the presence of gas or stool, and emotional stress. You’ll need to learn what your triggers are. You may need to make some lifestyle changes and take medication. Diet and lifestyle changes Usually, with a few basic changes in diet and activities, IBS will improve over time. Here are some tips to help ease symptoms:Common food ""triggers"" are red peppers, green onions, red wine, wheat, and cow's milk. If you're concerned about getting enough calcium, you can try to get it from other foods, like broccoli, spinach, turnip greens, tofu, yogurt, sardines, salmon with bones, calcium-fortified orange juice and breads, or calcium supplements.

You might feel rushed and forget to ask questions that are important. It's always a good idea to know what to ask beforehand and to take notes while with the doctor. Some of the questions below may be worth asking. Print out these questions and take them with you to your next appointment: 1. Could some other condition be causing my IBS symptoms? Could I have inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer? 2. Should I keep a diary of my IBS symptoms, and, if so, what should I write down? 3. Should I take laxatives or other over-the-counter medications? If so, what type, and how often is it safe to take them? 4. Would it help my IBS symptoms to add more fiber to my diet? If so, how much and what kind? 5. Are there other dietary changes you would recommend for IBS, and should I consult a dietitian? 6. Could relaxation therapy, counseling, or exercise help my IBS? 7. Should I take prescription medications for my IBS symptoms? If so, what side effects should I expect? 8. Are there any tests you would recommend now or in the future? 9. Are there any other approaches or treatments I should know about? 10. How soon should I have a follow-up appointment?"

Spermatocele (Epididymal Cyst),https://www.webmd.com/men/spermatocele-or-epididemal-cysts,"A spermatocele (also called a spermatic or epididymal cyst) is a fluid-filled sac that grows in the epididymis -- a tightly coiled tube about 20 feet long where the sperm matures as it passes through. It's in the scrotum and surrounds the back and top of the testicle. Spermatoceles vary in size. They typically don’t hurt, but they could cause pain if they grow too large. Spermatoceles can be smooth. They might also be filled with a whitish, cloudy fluid. Sometimes, they hold sperm. Most of the time, they’re benign (not cancerous). Still, if you notice a growth near or in your penis or scrotum (the pouch that holds your testicles), see your doctor to have it checked. Spermatoceles don’t impact fertility.",,"Spermatoceles often contain pools of dead sperm. Doctors aren’t sure what causes this. Often, spermatoceles develop for no specific reason at all. Sometimes they might happen when one of the tubes that transport and store sperm gets blocked.Spermatocele risk factors Spermatoceles are actually quite common. About 3 out of 10 men will get them at some point in their lives. Men ages 20-50 are most likely to get them. They don’t have many known risk factors. Men whose mothers took the drug diethylstilbestrol in pregnancy might get them more. Doctors stopped using this drug in 1971.","Most of the time, spermatoceles don’t hurt, so you may not have any symptoms. You might only feel a bump while examining your testicles. Your doctor might find it during an exam. As the cyst gets bigger, you may feel heaviness in your testicle. You might also notice a mass or swelling behind or above your testicle. Your doctor will likely do a couple of tests to make sure the growth is a spermatocele and not a tumor. They’ll probably start with a physical exam. You’ll also have a transillumination or an ultrasound.Transillumination is where your doctor shines a light through your scrotum. If the growth is a spermatocele, the light will shine through it. If it’s a mass, it won't. Ultrasound is the next step if transillumination doesn’t show fluid. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to create images on a screen.","Most of the time, they’re not treated. Your doctor may prescribe pain relievers to make you more comfortable. Aspiration is a procedure that can help relieve some of the pain and pressure of spermatoceles. Your doctor will insert a needle into the cyst to remove some of the fluid. If the cyst refills and comes back, your doctor can do a procedure called a sclerotherapy. Your doctor will drain some of the fluid from the spermatocele. Then they’ll use a substance that causes the sac to fill with scar tissue. This tissue could lower the risk of the spermatocele coming back. But it can damage the epididymis. Your doctor may suggest this option only if you’re not interested in having children. In rare cases (if the spermatocele is getting in the way of your daily life), your doctor could remove it through surgery. Your doctor will numb the area, make a small incision (cut) in your scrotum or groin, and remove the growth."
Spherocytic Anemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/autoimmune-hemolytic-anemia,"Red blood cells are made in the spongy material called bone marrow deep inside your bones. These blood cells normally live for about 120 days. If you have autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your body’s immune system attacks and destroys red blood cells faster than your bone marrow can make new ones. Sometimes these red blood cells live for only a few days. Most people who get AIHA are middle-aged or older. It’s rare in children, and it usually shows up soon after a viral illness and goes away on its own. If your teenager gets it, it could be a sign they have some other health problem.","Many of the symptoms of AIHA are the same as those of other forms of anemia. You may have:  Some symptoms are different depending on which type of AIHA you have. With cold antibody hemolytic anemia, you may also notice:","You can get autoimmune hemolytic anemia if you have an autoimmune disease like lupus. Normally when your immune system spots foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses, it makes proteins called antibodies to attack them. When you have AIHA, your immune system makes antibodies that mistakenly attack your own red blood cells. Other diseases and medications can also cause autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Some of these are:  ","If you think you could have any type of anemia, you should talk to your doctor. They may refer you to a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. They’ll most likely discuss your past medical history, medications you take, and talk about your symptoms. They’ll  also request a blood test called a complete blood count, or CBC, to look for signs of anemia. This test measures:A low red blood cell count and low hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are signs of anemia. If your CBC test results point to anemia, the doctor might want to do more tests. You might get one of these:","If you have a disease like lupus that’s causing your anemia, your doctor will treat it first. If a medication is the cause, you'll likely have to stop taking that medicine. If your AIHA is mild, you may not need treatment. Doctors usually first prescribe steroids, such as hydrocortisone or prednisone, to stop your immune system from attacking your red blood cells. A medicine called rituximab may make steroids work even better. If you don’t improve, you may need surgery to remove your spleen. That’s where much of the destruction of red blood cells takes place.  Other medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) can be used to suppress the immune system. You may need a blood transfusion.Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or AIHA, is a rare type of anemia. When you have anemia, your bone marrow doesn't make enough red blood cells. Or these cells don't work as well as they should. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your body. When you have too few red blood cells, your body can't get enough oxygen, leaving you feeling tired or short of breath."
Sphingolipidosis 1,https://www.webmd.com/children/gauchers-disease-symptoms-causes-treatments,"If you just found out that you or your child has Gaucher disease, it's natural to have lots of questions and concerns about what to expect. It's a rare condition that can cause a variety of symptoms, from weakening of your bones to easy bruising. Although there's no cure, it's important to keep in mind that depending on which type you have, treatment can help you manage some of the symptoms. Gaucher causes problems with the way your body gets rid of a certain kind of fat. With all types of this disease, an enzyme you need to break it down doesn't work right. The fat builds up, especially in your liver, spleen, and bone marrow, causing problems. There are three main types of Gaucher disease. Type 1 is the most common. If you have it, your symptoms may be mild, moderate, or severe, but some people don't notice any problems at all. There are several treatments for type 1. Type 2 and type 3 are more serious. Type 2 affects the brain and spinal cord. Babies with type 2 usually don't live past age 2. Type 3 also causes damage to the brain and spinal cord, but symptoms usually show up later in childhood.Gaucher disease can have many symptoms, including a swollen belly, bruising, and bleeding. Your blood might not clot well, or you might get anemia. It can also cause bone mineral loss that leads to pain and easily broken bones. It's passed along in families -- about 1 in 450 people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (from Eastern and Central Europe) have the condition. It's the most common genetic disease that affects Jewish people. Whether you have the disease or you're the parent of a child who has it, it's important to get support to help you face the challenges ahead. Reach out to your family and friends to get the backing you need. Ask your doctor about how to join a support group, where you can meet other people who are going through the same things you are.","How you feel depends on what type of Gaucher disease you've got. Type 1. It's the most common form. It usually doesn't affect your brain or spinal cord. Symptoms of type 1 can appear at any time in your life, but they usually show up by the teen years. Sometimes the disease is mild and you won't notice any problems. Some symptoms you might have are: Type 2. It affects the brain and spinal cord and is very serious. Babies with this form usually don't live past age 2. The symptoms include: Type 3. This type also affects the brain and spinal cord. The symptoms are similar to type 2, but they usually show up later in childhood and take longer to get worse.Perinatal lethal Gaucher disease. This is the most severe type. An infant with this form usually lives only a few days. These symptoms are overwhelming for a newborn: Cardiovascular Gaucher disease (type 3C). This is rare and mainly affects your heart. You might have symptoms like:","Gaucher disease isn't something you ""catch,"" like a cold or the flu. It's an inherited condition that's caused by a problem with the GBA gene.

You can pass a faulty gene on to your children even if you don't have Gaucher disease.","When you go to your doctor, they might ask:If your doctor thinks it's Gaucher disease, they can confirm that with a blood or saliva test. They'll also do tests regularly to track the condition. You may have an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan to see if your liver or spleen is swollen. You might also get a bone density test to check for any loss of bone. When Gaucher disease runs in your family, blood or saliva tests can help you find out if you could pass the disease to your child.","How you treat it depends on what type of Gaucher disease you have. Enzyme replacement therapy is one option for people who have type 1 and some with type 3. It helps reduce anemia and shrinks an enlarged spleen or liver. Enzyme replacement therapy medications may include: Other medications for type 1 are eliglustat (Cerdelga) and miglustat (Zavesca). They are pills that curb the process in your body that forms the fatty materials when you have an enzyme shortage.There's no treatment that can stop type 3 from causing damage to the brain, but researchers are always looking for new ways to fight the disease.

"Spider Bite, Brown Recluse",https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/spider-bite-brown-recluse-spider-bite-treatment,"A brown recluse might not be brown, but tan. It has a violin-shaped area on the front half of its body, with the neck of the violin pointing toward the spider’s abdomen.It may be bigger than other spiders that you’re used to seeing. Its body can range in size from a quarter-inch to three-quarters of an inch, and its long legs make it appear even larger. Most spiders have eight eyes, but a brown recluse spider has six. Two are in the front, and there are two more on each side of its head. Brown recluses are found mostly in the Midwest or the South. The spider favors indoor spaces, like attics, garages or dark closets. Outdoors, it hides in out-of-the-way places -- under logs, beneath porches, or within piles of rocks.","A bite might not hurt at first or even leave a mark. For some people, it feels like a pinch or a bee sting.

It’ll help if you can describe what the spider looked like. Some people try to catch the bug to show the doctor. That’s fine, as long as you can do it safely. You might just try to take a photo of it.","If you suspect your small child was bitten by a brown recluse, see your doctor right away. Their bodies can’t ward off the dangerous effects of the spider’s venom.For adults, most brown recluse spider bites can be treated at home with good results. But about 10% of them cause ulcers or blisters that damage your skin so badly that you need a doctor’s care. If your symptoms are mild, try these simple home remedies:See a doctor right away if you notice any of these symptoms: Some spider bites can have tetanus spores, so you might need a tetanus shot after you’ve been bitten. If you have an infection, you may need antibiotics.It’s rare for someone to stumble upon a brown recluse spider, because these eight-legged creatures are true to their name: They prefer to be left alone. They tend to live in indoor and outdoor spaces where people don’t go most of the time. If you do find yourself in the same place as one, though, it won’t want to attack you -- it’ll want to get out of your way. But if it feels trapped, it may bite you. Brown recluse spiders are one of two spiders found in the United States that can cause real trouble if they bite you. They produce harmful venom that may cause a painful sore at the site of the bite.

Spider Bites,https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/understanding-insect-bites-spider-bites-basic-information,"A sting is what happens when an insect injects poison (venom) into your skin. The venom travels through the bug’s stinger. That’s what it uses to defend itself from harm. If you get stung, you’ll feel pain. Your skin may turn red or swell at the site of the sting. In some cases, people who are allergic to the venom can have a life-threatening reaction. Doctors call this anaphylaxis. Among the most common stingers are: An insect bite happens when a non-venomous bug pierces your skin and feeds on your blood. This may cause a bump (doctors call them “papules”) to form. The telltale sign is intense itching. Examples of biters include: Among arachnids (eight legs instead of six) that cause these types of bites are ticks and some spiders. You can have an allergic reaction to a bite. Also, bugs that carry disease pass it on through their bites. This is often the case with ticks (Lyme disease) and mosquitoes (malaria, Zika virus).",,,,
Spider Veins,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/cosmetic-procedures-spider-veins,"There are seven major treatments for varicose veins and spider veins: 1. Support (compression) stockings. The most conservative approach is simply to wear properly fitting support hose, especially when the veins cause pain or discomfort. They create gentle pressure in the leg. That keeps blood from pooling in veins and also helps with leg swelling. These stockings can generally be purchased at any surgical supply store and at some pharmacies. They come in below-the-knee, above-the-knee, and pantyhose styles.2. Lifestyle changes. Good skin hygiene, weight loss (if needed), and walking can help treat varicose veins and spider veins. You can also try: 3. Sclerotherapy. This procedure can eliminate the pain and discomfort of varicose veins and prevent complications, such as ulcers or vein bleeding. It may also be used simply to improve appearance. Sclerotherapy uses a highly concentrated saline (salt) solution or a specially made detergent that is injected directly into the vein. The chemical irritates and scars the inside of the vein, making it collapse and causing the vein to disappear gradually over 3 to 6 weeks. It could take 6 months for larger veins to disappear.","Many people with varicose veins complain of pain, described as an aching or cramping in the legs. Other common symptoms include tiredness, restlessness, burning, throbbing, tingling, or heaviness in the legs. Pain from these veins is usually relieved by elevating the legs or by wearing support hose, also called compression stockings. In women, symptoms may be worse during certain parts of the menstrual cycle or during pregnancy. Less common is swelling, ulcers, and a darkening of the skin, especially in the ankle region. Occasionally, varicose veins can form a painful blood clot with inflammation of the vein, a condition called thrombophlebitis.",Varicose veins and spider veins develop more often in women than in men. They increase in frequency with age. An estimated 30% to 60% of adults have varicose veins or spider veins.,,"Many insurance companies cover the cost of treating varicose veins, but generally not spider veins. The best approach is to check with your insurance company before considering treatment options.Varicose veins are large, raised, swollen blood vessels that twist and turn. They usually develop in the legs and can be seen through the skin. They result from a weakening in the blood vessel wall or from faulty valves. They can show up anywhere on the body but most often appear on the legs or pelvic area. Spider veins are smaller, red, purple, and blue vessels that also twist and turn. Spider veins are easily visible through the skin, as well. They affect the capillaries, the body’s smallest blood vessels. Spider veins, which are red or blue, look like a spider’s web or tree branch. They are typically visible on the legs and face."

Spina Bifida,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/spina-bifida,"There are three main types of spina bifida: Spina bifida occulta (SBO): This is the most common and mildest form of the defect. Many people don't even know they have it. (""Occulta"" means ""hidden"" in Latin.) Here, the spinal cord and nerves are usually fine, but there might be a small gap in the spine. People often find out they have SBO when they get an X-ray for some other reason. This type of spina bifida doesn't typically cause any type of disability.Meningocele: This rare type of spina bifida happens when a sac of spinal fluid (but not the spinal cord) pushes through an opening in the baby's back. Some people have few or no symptoms, while others have problems with their bladder and bowels.  Myelomeningocele: This is the most severe type of spina bifida. Here, the baby's spinal canal is open in one or several places in the lower or middle back, and a sac of fluid pokes out. This sac also holds part of the spinal cord and the nerves, and those parts get damaged.","With spina bifida occulta, the most obvious sign might be a tuft of hair or a birthmark at the site of the defect. With meningocele and myelomeningocele, you can see the sac poking through the infant’s back. In the case of meningocele, there may be a thin layer of skin over the sac.With myelomeningocele, there’s usually no skin covering, and the spinal cord tissue is out in the open. Other associated symptoms range from:  Children also might have trouble breathing, swallowing, or moving their upper arms. They also might be overweight. The symptoms depend a lot on where the problem is in the spine and which spinal nerves are involved.","No one knows for sure what causes spina bifida. Scientists think it may be a combination of the environment and family history, or a lack of folic acid (a type of vitamin B) in the mother's body. But we do know that the condition is more common among white and Hispanic babies and in girls. Also, women who have diabetes that isn’t managed well or who are obese may be more likely to have a child with spina bifida.","Three tests can check for spina bifida and other birth defects while the baby is still in the womb: Blood test: A sample of the mother’s blood is tested to see if it has a certain protein the baby makes called AFP. If the level of AFP is very high, it could mean the baby has spina bifida or another neural tube defect. Ultrasound: High-frequency sound waves bounce off tissues in your body to make black-and-white pictures of the baby on a computer monitor. If your baby has spina bifida, you may see an open spine or a sac poking out of the spine.Amniocentesis: If the blood test shows a high level of AFP but the ultrasound looks normal, your doctor may recommend amniocentesis. This is when your doctor uses a needle to take a small amount of fluid from the amniotic sac around the baby. If there’s a high level of AFP in that fluid, that means the skin around the baby's sac is missing and AFP has leaked into the amniotic sac. Sometimes, spina bifida is diagnosed after a baby is born -- usually if the mother didn’t get prenatal care or the ultrasound didn't show anything wrong. The doctor probably will want to get X-rays of the baby’s body and do a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses strong magnets and radio waves to get more detailed images.","Doctors can operate on babies when they’re just a few days old or even while they’re still in the womb. If the baby has meningocele, about 24 to 48 hours after birth, the surgeon will put the membrane around the spinal cord back in place and close the opening.If the baby has myelomeningocele, the surgeon will put the tissue and spinal cord back inside the baby's body and cover it with skin. Sometimes the surgeon will also put a hollow tube into the baby’s brain called a shunt to keep water from collecting on the brain (called hydrocephalus). This is also done 24 to 48 hours after the baby’s born. Surgery sometimes can be done while the baby is still in the womb. Before the 26th week of pregnancy, the surgeon goes into the mother's womb and sews shut the opening over the baby's spinal cord. Children who have this type of surgery seem to have fewer birth defects. But it’s risky to the mother and makes it more likely that the baby will be born too early. After these surgeries, others may be needed to correct problems with feet, hips, or the spine or to replace the shunt in the brain. Between 20% and 50% of children with myelomeningocele may also have something called progressive tethering, which is when their spinal cords get fastened to the spinal canal. (Normally, the bottom of the spinal cord floats freely in the spinal canal.) As the child grows, the spinal cord stretches, and that causes a loss of muscle and bowel or bladder problems. Surgery may be needed to fix that as well. Some people with spina bifida need crutches, braces, or wheelchairs to move around, and others need a catheter to help with their bladder issues."

Treatment options for arachnoiditis are similar to those for other chronic pain conditions. Most treatments focus on relieving pain and improving symptoms that impair daily activities. Often, health care professionals recommend a program of pain management, physiotherapy, exercise, and psychotherapy. Surgery for arachnoiditis is controversial, because outcomes can be poor and provide only short-term relief. Clinical trials of steroid injections and electrical stimulation are needed to determine whether those treatments are effective. The nerves of the brain and the spinal cord are protected by three surrounding membranes: the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater. Arachnoiditis is a pain disorder that develops when the arachnoid becomes inflamed. It is characterized by severe stinging, burning pain, and neurological problems."
Spinal Chordoma,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-chordoma,"In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born.In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull. Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly. This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances.","Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is.

These include: A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have. Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.","Your treatment will depend on:Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back. Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return. Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery. Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.  Chordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year. You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women. Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly. Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully."

If the spine is weak because of another condition, such as arthritis, minor injuries can cause spinal cord trauma.", ,"A spinal cord injury requires immediate treatment in order to address life-threatening complications and to decrease the risk of long-term problems. Corticosteroid drugs such as dexamethasone (Decadron) or methylprednisolone (Medrol) are used to reduce swelling. In some cases, surgery may be recommended. Bed rest may be needed in order for the spine to heal. After an acute spinal cord injury, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other rehabilitation interventions sometimes are required. There is no cure for spinal cord injury. Researchers continue to work on advances, many of which have resulted in a decrease in damage at the time of the injury.The spinal cord is the major bundle of nerves carrying impulses to and from your brain to the rest of your body. Rings of bone, called vertebrae, surround the spinal cord. These bones make up your spinal column, also called your backbone. Spinal cord injury is the result of a direct trauma to the nerves themselves or from damage to the bones and soft tissues and vessels around the spinal cord. Spinal cord damage results in a loss of function, such as mobility or feeling. With most injuries, the spinal cord is not completely severed but either bruised or torn. Spinal cord injury is not the same as a back injury, which may result from pinched nerves or ruptured disks. Even when a person has a break in a vertebra or vertebrae, there may not be any spinal cord injury if the spinal cord itself is not affected."

You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation.Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus like herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. There is a possibility of being hospitalized if you are dehydrated or have severe symptoms.  "
Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA),https://www.webmd.com/brain/spinal-muscular-atrophy,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) most often affects babies and children and makes it hard for them to use their muscles. When your child has SMA, there's a breakdown of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The brain stops sending messages that control muscle movement. When that happens, your child's muscles get weak and shrink, and children can have trouble controlling head movement, sitting without help, and even walking. In some cases, they can have trouble swallowing and breathing as the disease gets worse. There are different types of SMA, and how serious it is depends on which type your child has. There's no cure, but treatments can improve some symptoms and, in some cases, help your child live longer. Researchers are working to find new ways to fight the disease. Keep in mind that every child or adult who has SMA will have a different experience. No matter how much your child's movement is limited, the disease doesn't affect their intelligence in any way. They will still be able to make friends and socialize.","Symptoms vary a lot, depending on the type of SMA: Type 0. This is the rarest and most severe form of SMA and develops while you’re still pregnant. Babies with this type of SMA move less in the womb and are born with joint problems, weak muscle tone, and weak muscles for breathing. They often do not survive due to breathing problems.  Type 1. This is also a severe type of SMA. A child may not be able to support their head or sit without help. They may have floppy arms and legs and problems swallowing. The biggest concern is weakness in the muscles that control breathing. Most children with type 1 SMA don't live past age 2 because of breathing problems. Keep in touch with your medical team, family members, clergy, and others who can help give you the emotional support you need while your child fights this disease. Type 2. This affects children 6-18 months old. The symptoms range from moderate to severe and usually involve the legs more than the arms. Your child may be able to sit and walk or stand with help.Type 2 is also called chronic infantile SMA. Type 3. Symptoms for this type start when children are 2-17 years old. It's the mildest form of the disease. Your child will most likely be able to stand or walk without help but may have problems running, climbing stairs, or getting up from a chair. Later in life, they may need a wheelchair to get around. Type 3 is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease or juvenile SMA. Type 4. This form of SMA starts when you're an adult. You may have symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, or breathing problems. Usually, only your upper arms and legs are affected. You'll have the symptoms throughout your life, but you can keep moving and even get better with exercises that you'll practice with the help of a physical therapist. It's important to remember that there's a lot of variation in the way this type of SMA affects people. Many people, for instance, are able to keep working for many years. Ask your doctor about ways to meet with others who have the same condition and know what you're going through.","SMA is a disease that's passed down through families. If your child has SMA, it's because they have two copies of a broken gene, one from each parent. When this happens, their body won't be able to make a specific kind of protein. Without it, the cells that control muscles die. If your child gets a faulty gene from just one of you, they won't get SMA but will be a carrier of the disease. When your child grows up, they could pass the broken gene to their own child.","SMA can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms may be similar to other conditions. To help figure out what's going on, your doctor may ask you:Your doctor may also order some tests that can help make a diagnosis. For example, they may take a blood sample from your child to check for missing or broken genes that can cause SMA. Your doctor could also order a blood test that checks for creatine kinase (CK). It’s an enzyme that leaks out of weakening muscles. High blood CK levels aren’t always harmful but do show possible muscle damage. Other tests rule out conditions that have similar symptoms:","The FDA has approved three medications to treat SMA: nusinersen (Spinraza), onasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma) and risdiplam (Evrysdi). Both are forms of gene therapy that affect the genes involved in SMA. The SMN1 and SMN2 genes give your body instructions for making a protein that helps with controlling muscle movement.Besides gene therapy, your doctor may suggest a few other ways to help manage symptoms:  "
Spinal Stenosis,https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/guide/spinal-stenosis,"  Spinal stenosis is a condition, mostly in adults 50 and older, in which your spinal canal starts to narrow. This can cause pain and other problems. Your spine is made up of a series of connected bones (or vertebrae) and shock-absorbing discs. It protects your spinal cord, a key part of the central nervous system that connects your brain to your body. The cord rests in the canal formed by your vertebrae. There are two different types of spinal stenosis. The type you have depends on where on your spine the condition is. You can have one or both types of spinal stenosis. Lumbar stenosis is the most common. For most people, stenosis results from changes caused by arthritis. As the spinal canal narrows, the open spaces between your vertebrae start to get smaller. The tightness can pinch the spinal cord or the nerves around it, causing pain, tingling, or numbness in your legs, arms, or torso. There’s no cure, but there are a variety of nonsurgical treatments and exercises to keep the pain at bay. Most people with spinal stenosis live normal lives.","Spinal stenosis usually affects your neck or lower back. Not everyone has symptoms, but if you do, they tend to be the same: stiffness, numbness, and back pain. More specific symptoms include: If you’re having symptoms, talk them over with your doctor. If you’re having a loss of bladder or bowel control, call your doctor at once.","The leading reason for spinal stenosis is arthritis, a condition caused by the breakdown of cartilage -- the cushiony material between your bones -- and the growth of bone tissue. Osteoarthritis can lead to disc changes, a thickening of the ligaments of the spine, and bone spurs. This can put pressure on your spinal cord and spinal nerves. Other causes include: Some people are born with spinal stenosis or diseases that lead to it. For them, the condition usually starts to cause problems between the ages of 30 and 50. Risks for spinal stenosis vary with age. For example:","The doctor will ask questions about your medical history. After that, they might order at least one of the following tests to figure out whether you have the condition:",The treatment you need for your spinal stenosis depends on where the stenosis is and how severe your symptoms are. You might need:Medication You might take:
Spinocerebellar Ataxia,https://www.webmd.com/brain/ataxia-types-brain-and-nervous-system,"Ataxia is a movement disorder caused by problems in the brain. When you have ataxia, you have trouble moving parts of your body the way you want. Or the muscles in your arms and legs might move when you don’t want them to. The word ataxia actually means “without coordination.”  Ataxia isn’t a disorder or a disease itself -- it’s a sign of other underlying disorders or diseases. Doctors have discovered anywhere from 50 to 100 different ataxias. They are grouped into categories based on what causes them, or based on which part of the body they affect.",,"Around 150,000 people in the U.S. deal with some form of ataxia. There are different causes for it. Some are genetic, some are acquired, like injuries, and some have no known clear cause. Genetic. You can inherit a certain mutated, or changed, gene from one or both of your parents that causes ataxia. Or you may inherit a mutated gene that causes a disorder with ataxia as a symptom. Some of the specific types of genetic ataxia include: Acquired. Acquired ataxia occurs when you have damage to your spinal cord or nerves. The damage might be from an injury or an illness. Some of the causes of acquired ataxia could include:You can also get ataxia if you have a reaction to certain medications, from alcohol or drug use, or from exposure to poison. Idiopathic. When you haven’t inherited a mutated gene or had an illness or injury that could have caused your ataxia, it’s called idiopathic ataxia. Your doctor will diagnose you with idiopathic ataxia if they can’t find a medical reason for your ataxia symptoms. The most common idiopathic ataxia is called multiple system atrophy, or MSA. Doctors haven’t pinned down possible causes for this group of ataxias. They may come from a combination of environmental factors and genetic causes.",,"The best treatment for your ataxia symptoms depends on the type you have. There is no specific treatment for ataxia itself. If your ataxia is a symptom of another disorder, your doctor will treat that disorder. If it’s due to a cause that you can avoid, like lack of vitamins or exposure to poison, your doctor will help you address the problem causing the ataxia. In order to help you cope with your symptoms, your doctor may recommend: Your doctor can also help you find tools so you can move around easier, such as a cane or a walker. There are also utensils to help you eat and speak more easily. Learn more about qualifying for disability for ataxia."
Spiritual Healing,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/guide/pain-management-alternative-therapy,"Mind-body therapies are treatments that are meant to help the mind’s ability to affect the functions and symptoms of the body. Mind-body therapies use various approaches, including relaxation techniques, meditation, guided imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis. Relaxation techniques can help alleviate discomfort related to chronic pain.Visualization, also known as guided visualization, may be another worthwhile pain-controlling technique. Try the following exercise: Close your eyes and try to call up a visual image of the pain, giving it shape, color, size, motion. Now try slowly altering this image, replacing it with a more harmonious, pleasing -- and smaller -- image. Another approach is to keep a diary of your pain episodes and the causative and corrective factors surrounding them. Review your diary regularly to explore avenues of possible change. Strive to view pain as part of life, not all of it. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback may alert you to the ways in which muscle tension is contributing to your pain and help you learn to control it. Hypnotherapy and self-hypnosis may help you block or transform pain through refocusing techniques. One self-hypnosis strategy, known as glove anesthesia, involves putting yourself in a trance, placing a hand over the painful area, imagining that the hand is relaxed, heavy, and numb, and envisioning these sensations as replacing other, painful feelings in the affected area. Relaxation techniques such as meditation or yoga have been shown to reduce stress-related pain when they are practiced regularly. The gentle stretching of yoga is particularly good for strengthening muscles without putting additional strain on the body.",,,,"Some people believe that changing dietary fat intake and/or consuming plant foods that contain anti-inflammatory agents can help ease pain by limiting inflammation. A mostly raw vegetarian diet was found helpful for some people with fibromyalgia, but this study was not randomized and was without a control group. One study of women with premenstrual symptoms suggested that a low-fat vegetarian diet was associated with decreased pain intensity and duration. Weight loss achieved by a combination of dietary changes and increased physical activity has been shown to be helpful for people suffering from osteoarthritis. Still, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of dietary modifications as a pain treatment."
Splenomegalic Polycythemia,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/polycythemia-vera,"Polycythemia vera (PV) is a blood cancer that begins in the marrow of your bones, the soft center where new blood cells grow. It causes your marrow to make too many red blood cells so your blood is too thick. You may be more likely to have clots, a stroke, or a heart attack. This disease gets worse slowly, usually over many years. It can be life-threatening if you don't get treatment, but the right care can help you live a long life. Most people who have PV don’t get diagnosed until they’re 60 or older, usually after a routine blood test. But it can happen at any age. Men get it more often than women. It's common to worry when you find out that you have cancer. Remember that everyone is different and that all cancers aren’t the same. With the support of your doctor, family, friends, and other people who have polycythemia vera, you’ll be in the best position to manage it. ","At first, you may not notice any problems. When they do show up, polycythemia vera symptoms can include: You may also feel pressure or fullness below your ribs on your left side. This might mean PV has enlarged your spleen, an organ that helps filter your blood.","Your bone marrow makes three types of blood cells: Red blood cells carry oxygen, white ones fight infections, and platelets clot your blood to stop bleeding. Most people with polycythemia vera have too many red blood cells. But it can also cause you to have too many white blood cells and platelets. PV is caused by a gene (either JAK2 or TET2) that doesn’t work the way it should. Most likely, the problem happened over the course of your life. Rarely, parents can pass these faulty genes to children.","Your doctor will start with a physical exam, including a check of your spleen. They’ll ask about your symptoms and see if your face is unusually red. You may have some blood tests, including:You may also need a bone marrow biopsy. The results can show your doctor if your bone marrow makes too many blood cells. For this test, your doctor will take samples of your marrow, usually from the back of your hip bone. You lie down on a table and get a shot that will numb the area. Then, your doctor uses a needle to take out a small amount of bone marrow. It's an outpatient procedure, which means you don't have to stay overnight in a hospital. You can get it done in a clinic, a hospital, or your doctor's office. Questions for your doctor Before your appointment, it's a good idea to make a list of things to ask your doctor, such as:  ","If you don't have many symptoms, you might not need treatment for PV right away. Your doctor will keep a close watch on you. If you do need treatment, it will be aimed at lowering the amount of red blood cells your body makes and preventing blood clots and other complications. Your options include: Phlebotomy. This is often the first treatment for people who have polycythemia vera. Your doctor takes blood from your vein so you have fewer blood cells. It's a lot like donating blood. After it's done, your blood will be thinner, and it’ll flow more easily. You'll usually feel better, too. Some symptoms will ease, like headaches or dizziness. Your doctor will decide how often you need phlebotomy. Some people with PV don’t need any other treatment for many years. Low-dose aspirin. This keeps platelets from sticking together. That makes you less likely to get blood clots, which in turn makes heart attacks or strokes less likely. Most people with polycythemia vera take low-dose aspirin.Medicine to lower blood cells. If you need more help, your doctor may prescribe hydroxyurea (Droxia, Hydrea), a pill that lowers your red blood count and eases symptoms. Other drugs like interferon alfa (Intron A) or ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft (Besremi) help your immune system cut back on making blood cells. You might take busulfan (Busulfex, Myleran) or ruxolitinib (Jakafi) if hydroxyurea isn’t helpful or if it causes severe side effects. If you have itching that doesn't go away, your doctor may give you antihistamines."
Splenomegaly with Rheumatoid Arthritis,https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/felty-syndrome,"Doctors aren't sure what causes FS. Your white blood cells may have stopped fighting infections like they should. Or your bone marrow could be making abnormal white blood cells. Another theory is that your immune system attacks your white blood cells by mistake. FS doesn't always run in families, but some genes that raise your chances of getting it could be passed down to you.","Signs of FS are similar to those of rheumatoid arthritis. They also overlap other autoimmune diseases -- a disease in which your immune system attacks your own healthy cells -- like lupus. Because of that, FS can be hard to diagnose.You may have: You also will have a swollen spleen -- a fist-sized organ behind your left ribs. It controls the amount of white blood cells in your body and plays a key part in your immune system. If your spleen is bigger than normal, you may feel pain behind your left rib cage. You also may feel full soon after you eat because it's pressing against your stomach. Other times, an enlarged spleen doesn't cause any symptoms.","Doctors aren't sure what causes FS.

Less than 3% of people with RA develop FS, but those in their 50s, 60s, and 70s who've had RA for 10 years or longer are more likely to have it. It's also three times more common in women than men. Children rarely get FS."
Splint Care Tips,https://www.webmd.com/first-aid/firstaid-care-for-cast,"You’ll likely get one of two main kinds of casts. Both are hard, and both go on top of a layer of cotton or other soft padding that rests on your skin. Plaster cast. This is made of plaster of Paris, a white powder that, when mixed with water, turns into a thick paste that hardens. Take care not to get your cast wet. It can start to dissolve or irritate your skin. Take baths instead of showers. Cover the cast with a plastic bag or a sleeve sold in drugstores. If it gets wet, dry it with a blow-dryer on a cool setting, or suck air through the cast with a vacuum cleaner hose.Fiberglass cast. Also called a synthetic cast, it's made of fiberglass, which is a type of plastic that can be shaped. It’s lighter and more durable and expensive than plaster casts. X-rays also “see” through it better. Fiberglass is water-resistant. But the padding underneath is not, so it’s best to keep it away from water. If you don’t have a fracture, your doctor may recommend a cast made of elastic or other soft material. It can be removed without a cast saw and could be a good choice for young children or someone who’s had surgery.",,,,

That means children can have many problems, including:For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures. Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell. While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought.

Herpes-related encephalitis can erupt rapidly, and may cause seizures or mental changes and even lead to coma or death. It occurs when the herpes simplex type 1 virus travels to the brain rather than moving through the body to the surface of the skin and producing its more common symptom, a cold sore. Early recognition and treatment of herpes encephalitis can be life-saving. You are not more likely to get encephalitis if you have cold sores. Arbovirus encephalitis is another form of viral encephalitis. It is caused by various viruses that are carried by insects (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Unlike herpes, arboviral infections are seasonal, occurring primarily in summer and early fall, and are clustered in specific regions, such as in the case of St. Louis encephalitis.

Sunburn is the most obvious sign that you've been sitting outside for too long. But sun damage isn't always visible. Under the surface, ultraviolet light can alter your DNA, prematurely aging your skin. Over time, DNA damage can contribute to skin cancers, including deadly melanoma.

Supraventricular Tachycardia,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-supraventricular-tachycardia,"Tachycardia is a faster-than-normal heart rate at rest. If you have this condition, your heart beats too quickly -- more than 100 times a minute. The ""supra"" in supraventricular means above the ventricles. With this condition, the fast heartbeat starts in the top chambers of the heart, the atria. When electrical signals in the atria fire off early, the atria contract too soon. That interrupts the main electrical signal coming from the SA node. This results in the heart beating very quickly through an abnormal and separate pathway. This condition is divided into three types: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common form. If you have it, there’s an extra pathway in your heart that causes an electrical signal to circle around and around instead of moving down to the ventricles. This can trigger the rapid heartbeat. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia happens when an abnormal pathway links the atria and ventricles, causing the signal to move around and around in a big loop.If you have the inherited condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, you have this extra pathway. This condition can be serious. If it is part of your family history, have it checked. Atrial tachycardia happens when a short circuit in the right or left atrium triggers a faulty electrical signal. Bouts of any of these can last from a few seconds to a few hours. When SVT only happens from time to time, it's called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.","When your heart beats too quickly, it doesn't have time to fully refill with blood in between beats. That means it can't send enough blood out to your body. That can cause:","Most of the time, SVT happens without any obvious reason. It often starts when you are in your teens or early 20s. Sometimes you are born with abnormal pathways or electrical circuits in your heart. Faulty circuits can also form out of scar tissue left behind after surgery. Your heart is more likely to race if you:","If you have symptoms, your doctor will ask you detailed questions. They’ll want to know how old you were when you first noticed a problem. They’ll also ask when and how your symptoms began. That includes whether you were exercising when you noticed things such as a rapid pulse, dizziness or a hard time breathing. Other things they’ll ask you about: During your exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. They might also:EKG test If your doctor suspects supraventricular tachycardia after hearing about your symptoms, examining you and running some basic tests, they might ask you to get an EKG. You may hear them call it an “electrocardiogram” or an ECG. This test records your heart’s rhythm over time, so if it’s not beating as it should, it can reveal what the problem is. If you’re getting one, there’s nothing special you need to do ahead of time to get ready. To set up the test, a nurse or technician will attach six sticky patches called electrodes on your chest and others on your arms and legs. If you have a hairy chest, an aide may need to shave small areas so they stay put. Each one will go with a wire that leads to a machine. During the test, which takes just a few minutes, you’ll be asked to lie still and breathe normally.","One treatment for SVT uses medicine to slow the heartbeat. If that doesn't fix the problem for you, another option is called ablation. In this procedure, a surgeon burns the pathway that causes the abnormal electrical signals. If you feel like your heart is fluttering and you have any of the symptoms listed above, make an appointment with your doctor to be tested.Sometimes, a problem with your heart's electrical signals can make it speed up, even when you're not anxious or exercising. One type of faster-than-normal heartbeat is called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVT is a group of heart conditions that all have a few things in common. The term has Latin roots. Supraventricular means “above the ventricles,” which are the lower two sections of your heart. Tachycardia means “fast heart rate.” Other conditions can cause your heart to beat too fast. Your doctor will need all the details of your symptoms. They’ll also do a physical exam and record your heartbeats to be sure of the diagnosis. Most of the time, it doesn't cause any serious health problems even though a racing heartbeat can be a scary feeling. Still, you should see your doctor about it. When your heart beats too quickly, it can't pump out enough blood to meet your body's needs. Sometimes you might have a drop in blood pressure and feel dizzy or lightheaded. Other times, the only feeling is the rapid heartbeat. Your doctor can try to bring your heart back into a regular rhythm with medicines and other treatments."

Your surgeon may also have to create new pockets to hold implants or replace them with narrower ones. It’s possible to treat the congenital kind, but your surgeon has to fix both the structure and size of your breasts. Experts don’t agree on which type of surgery is best. Different operations may work better for different people. In general, you shouldn’t have surgery until your breasts have finished growing. One technique that has worked well for this type uses a three-step procedure. The first step uses liposuction or surgery to take out a small amount of breast tissue. Then, the surgeon attaches the skin at the cleavage area to the breastbone. Finally, they compress the area to help the skin and chest wall heal. You’ll also need to wear a compression bra for a while. Possible complications include scarring and breasts that aren’t the same size or shape.

The most commonly affected areas include the face and the back of the: You may get symptoms on your skin such as:  ","No matter what kind of porphyria you have, it has the same root cause: a problem with how your body makes a substance called heme. Heme is part of the ""hemoglobin"" in your blood -- proteins that carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of your body. Heme has iron and gives blood its red color. It's made in your liver and bone marrow -- the spongy center of your bones. A variety of enzymes play a role in the process. If you have porphyria, your body doesn't have enough of some of these enzymes. This shortage leads to a buildup of certain chemicals, called porphyrins, that help make heme.The type of porphyria you have is linked to the specific enzyme that your body lacks. Most types of porphyria are inherited. That means one or both of your parents passes a mutated gene to you that leads to the disease. One common type of cutaneous porphyria, known as porphyria cutanea tarda, is sometimes passed through genes but can also be what doctors call an ""acquired disease."" In that case, certain conditions or actions can trigger symptoms of porphyria.

Surgery to correct the abnormal connections between bones is the main treatment for Apert syndrome. In general, surgery for Apert syndrome takes place in three steps: 1. Release of skull bone fusion (craniosynostosis release). A surgeon separates the abnormally fused skull bones and partially rearranges some of them. This surgery is usually performed when a child is between ages 6 and 8 months.2. Midface advancement. As the child with Apert syndrome grows, the facial bones again become misaligned. A surgeon cuts the bones in the jaw and cheeks and brings them forward into a more normal position. This surgery may be done at any time between ages 4 and 12. Additional corrective surgery may be needed, especially when midface advancement is done at a young age. 3. Correction of wide-set eyes (hypertelorism correction). A surgeon removes a wedge of bone in the skull between the eyes. The surgeon brings the eye sockets closer together, and may adjust the jaw, too.

It causes droopy eyelids, narrowing of the opening between the eyelids, reduced pupil size, and decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.","You get this condition when something blocks the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, which protects your spinal cord and brain. It enters the central canal of the spinal cord and can cause a cyst to form. With syringomyelia, there are two main reasons this fluid can get blocked or rerouted: a birth defect or trauma.Congenital syringomyelia, also called communicating syringomyelia, usually happens when there’s a problem with the baby’s brain development during pregnancy. A defect that doctors call a “Chiari I malformation” causes the lower part of the baby’s brain to push downward into their spinal canal. This blocks the normal flow of fluid between the spine and the brain, and a cyst forms. But not everyone with a Chiari I malformation gets this disorder. Symptoms usually show up between ages 25 and 40. Acquiredsyringomyelia, also called primary spinal or noncommunicating syringomyelia, is when a cyst forms in a damaged part of the spinal cord. It may happen when there is: Sometimes, it happens for reasons doctors don’t understand. They call this “idiopathic syringomyelia.”","Doctors use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain and spine to see if you have syringomyelia. The MRI can show a cyst or other condition. Sometimes, doctors discover you have this condition when doing an MRI for another health reason. You might also have a kind of X-ray procedure called a CT scan of your spine.","What kind of treatment you get for syringomyelia depends on whether you have symptoms, and how serious they are. Monitoring: You probably won’t need treatment if you don’t have symptoms or if they’ve mild. But you should have regular checkups to watch for cyst growth and changes in signs and symptoms. The doctor may tell you to avoid activities like heavy lifting that involve straining. They might also prescribe medicine for pain or refer you to physical therapy. Surgery: If your symptoms cause problems, you may need surgery to restore the normal flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. The type of surgery you’ll have depends on what caused your syringomyelia. For example, if the problem is due to a Chiari I malformation, your doctor might do a procedure called posterior fossa decompression. They’ll remove the bone at the back of your skull and spine. It creates more space for your brainstem and cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls your movements and balance. Talk to the doctor about the risks and benefits of surgery."

It can affect any organ, including your lungs, liver, brain, spleen, or lymph nodes. In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs.  LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.Along with your bones, it can affect your:  Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap, a common skin condition. Liver. Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears, in the neck, and in other places, can swell up.

About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: ","Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy. That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam, your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: ","As with some types of cancer, doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy. Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and haematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH. It most commonly appears in toddlers and very young children, but you can have it as an adult, too."

"Tachycardia, Supraventricular",https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-supraventricular-tachycardia,"Tachycardia is a faster-than-normal heart rate at rest. If you have this condition, your heart beats too quickly -- more than 100 times a minute. The ""supra"" in supraventricular means above the ventricles. With this condition, the fast heartbeat starts in the top chambers of the heart, the atria. When electrical signals in the atria fire off early, the atria contract too soon. That interrupts the main electrical signal coming from the SA node. This results in the heart beating very quickly through an abnormal and separate pathway. This condition is divided into three types: Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common form. If you have it, there’s an extra pathway in your heart that causes an electrical signal to circle around and around instead of moving down to the ventricles. This can trigger the rapid heartbeat. Atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia happens when an abnormal pathway links the atria and ventricles, causing the signal to move around and around in a big loop.If you have the inherited condition called Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, you have this extra pathway. This condition can be serious. If it is part of your family history, have it checked. Atrial tachycardia happens when a short circuit in the right or left atrium triggers a faulty electrical signal. Bouts of any of these can last from a few seconds to a few hours. When SVT only happens from time to time, it's called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.","When your heart beats too quickly, it doesn't have time to fully refill with blood in between beats. That means it can't send enough blood out to your body. That can cause:","Most of the time, SVT happens without any obvious reason. It often starts when you are in your teens or early 20s. Sometimes you are born with abnormal pathways or electrical circuits in your heart. Faulty circuits can also form out of scar tissue left behind after surgery. Your heart is more likely to race if you:","If you have symptoms, your doctor will ask you detailed questions. They’ll want to know how old you were when you first noticed a problem. They’ll also ask when and how your symptoms began. That includes whether you were exercising when you noticed things such as a rapid pulse, dizziness or a hard time breathing. Other things they’ll ask you about: During your exam, your doctor will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. They might also:EKG test If your doctor suspects supraventricular tachycardia after hearing about your symptoms, examining you and running some basic tests, they might ask you to get an EKG. You may hear them call it an “electrocardiogram” or an ECG. This test records your heart’s rhythm over time, so if it’s not beating as it should, it can reveal what the problem is. If you’re getting one, there’s nothing special you need to do ahead of time to get ready. To set up the test, a nurse or technician will attach six sticky patches called electrodes on your chest and others on your arms and legs. If you have a hairy chest, an aide may need to shave small areas so they stay put. Each one will go with a wire that leads to a machine. During the test, which takes just a few minutes, you’ll be asked to lie still and breathe normally.","One treatment for SVT uses medicine to slow the heartbeat. If that doesn't fix the problem for you, another option is called ablation. In this procedure, a surgeon burns the pathway that causes the abnormal electrical signals. If you feel like your heart is fluttering and you have any of the symptoms listed above, make an appointment with your doctor to be tested.Sometimes, a problem with your heart's electrical signals can make it speed up, even when you're not anxious or exercising. One type of faster-than-normal heartbeat is called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVT is a group of heart conditions that all have a few things in common. The term has Latin roots. Supraventricular means “above the ventricles,” which are the lower two sections of your heart. Tachycardia means “fast heart rate.” Other conditions can cause your heart to beat too fast. Your doctor will need all the details of your symptoms. They’ll also do a physical exam and record your heartbeats to be sure of the diagnosis. Most of the time, it doesn't cause any serious health problems even though a racing heartbeat can be a scary feeling. Still, you should see your doctor about it. When your heart beats too quickly, it can't pump out enough blood to meet your body's needs. Sometimes you might have a drop in blood pressure and feel dizzy or lightheaded. Other times, the only feeling is the rapid heartbeat. Your doctor can try to bring your heart back into a regular rhythm with medicines and other treatments."
Tai Chi and Qi Gong,https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/a-z/tai-chi-and-chi-gong,"The ancient Chinese practices of tai chi and qi gong (pronounced CHEE-gung) combine slow, deliberate movements, meditation, and breathing exercises.

They can also help restore your energy, called chi or qi (pronounced ""chee""). The low-impact moving meditations include standing and balancing. Although qi gong and tai chi are excellent fitness activities for beginners and people with health conditions, elite athletes also benefit from doing the slow movements, because everyone needs better balance and muscle control.

Takayasu Disease,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/takayasus-arteritis,"In the U.S. and Japan, Takayasu's arteritis is fatal in only about 3% of patients who have had the disease for an average of five years. This encouraging statistic is the product of recognizing the disease and treating it appropriately. Reports from other parts of the world have been less optimistic, possibly because it is not as readily recognized and treated.","Approximately half of all people with Takayasu's arteritis will have a sense of generalized illness. This may include low grade fevers, swollen glands, anemia, dizziness, night sweats, muscle aches, and/or arthritis. The changes that occur in Takayasu's arteritis are often gradual, allowing alternate (collateral) routes of blood flow to develop. These alternate routes are typically smaller blood vessels. The collateral vessels may not be able to carry as much blood as the normal vessels. In general, however, the blood flow that occurs beyond an area of narrowing is almost always adequate to allow tissues to survive. In rare cases, if collateral blood vessels are not available in sufficient quantity, the tissue that is normally supplied with blood and oxygen by those vessels will die. Narrowing of blood vessels to the arms or legs may cause fatigue, pain, or aching due to reduced blood supply -- especially during activities such as shampooing the hair, exercising, or walking. It is much less common for decreased blood flow to cause a stroke or a heart attack. In some people, decreased blood flow to the intestines may lead to abdominal pain, especially after meals.Decreased blood flow to the kidneys may cause high blood pressure, but rarely causes kidney failure. Some people with Takayasu's arteritis may not have any symptoms. Their diagnosis may be discovered when their doctor attempts to take their blood pressure and has trouble getting a reading in one or both arms. Similarly, a doctor may notice that the strength of pulses in the wrists, neck, or groin may not be equal, or the pulse on one side may be absent.",The exact cause of Takayasu's arteritis is unknown.,,"Corticosteroids -- often called simply ""steroids"" -- are the most common treatment for Takayasu's arteritis. Steroids work within hours after the first dose is given. While this drug often is dramatically effective, it may be only partially effective for some people. Once it is apparent that the disease is under control, doctors slowly reduce the dosage of prednisone (a steroid) to sustain improvement, thereby trying to minimize treatment side effects. In some people, it is possible to gradually discontinue medication without a relapse.As the dosage of prednisone is gradually reduced, about half of all patients will have recurrent symptoms or progression of illness. This has led researchers to explore additional treatments to produce remission. Among medications that have been tried, with varying degrees of success, are immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate. When these drugs are added to prednisone to treat Takayasu's arteritis, 50% of patients who had previously relapsed will achieve remission and be able to gradually discontinue prednisone. Overall, about 25% of patients will have disease that is not entirely controlled without continued use of these treatments. This emphasizes the need for continuing research to identify better and less toxic treatments for Takayasu's arteritis and other forms of vasculitis."

Tardive Muscular Dystrophy,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-muscular-dystrophy-basics,"Muscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited diseases in which the muscles that control movement (called voluntary muscles) progressively weaken. In some forms of this disease, the heart and other organs are also affected. There are nine major forms of muscular dystrophy: Muscular dystrophy can appear in infancy up to middle age or later, and its form and severity are determined in part by the age at which it occurs. Some types of muscular dystrophy typicallyaffect only males; some people with MD enjoy a normal life span with mild symptoms that progress very slowly; others experience swift and severe muscle weakness and wasting, dying in their late teens to early 20s. The various types of MD affect more than 50,000 Americans. Through advances in medical care, children with muscular dystrophy are living longer than ever before.",,"Muscular dystrophy is caused by defects in certain genes, with type determined by the abnormal gene. In 1986, researchers discovered the gene that, when defective or flawed, causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In 1987, the muscle protein associated with this gene was named dystrophin. Duchenne muscular dystrophy occurs when that gene fails to make dystrophin. Becker muscular dystrophy occurs when a different mutation in the same gene results in some dystrophin, but it's either not enough or it's poor in quality. Scientists have discovered and continue to search for the genetic defects that cause other forms of muscular dystrophy. Most of the muscular dystrophies are a form of inherited disease called X-linked disorders or genetic diseases that mothers can transmit to their sons even though the mothers themselves are unaffected by the disease. Men carry one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. Females carry two X chromosomes. Thus, in order for a girl to become affected by muscular dystrophy, both their X chromosomes would have to carry the defective gene -- an extremely rare occurrence, since their mother would have to be a carrier (one defective X chromosome) and their father would have to have muscular dystrophy (since men carry just one X chromosome, the other is a Y chromosome).A female who carries the defective X chromosome can pass the disease to their son (whose other chromosome is a Y, from the father). A few muscular dystrophies aren't inherited at all and occur because of a new gene abnormality or mutation.","To start, your doctor will examine your child and ask questions about medical and family health history. Muscular dystrophy is diagnosed using several different tests. These may include:  Muscle biopsy. A small piece of muscle tissue is removed and examined to confirm the diagnosis or rule out another muscle disease. Genetic (DNA) testing. Genes passed down through families can cause some forms of muscular dystrophy. A blood test can determine if you or your child has the gene.  Neurological tests. Various tests are done to check nervous system function, reflexes, and coordination. One example is a nerve conduction study, also called a nerve function test, or electromyography (EMG).Enzyme tests. These are blood tests that check for proteins, or enzymes, linked to muscle weakness. People with muscular dystrophy have high levels of the enzyme creatine kinase. It’s made when muscles are damaged. They also have higher levels of serum aldolase, which is made when your body breaks down sugar into energy.","There is no cure for muscular dystrophy, but treatments can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications Prescription drugs are available to control muscular dystrophy symptoms or slow their progression. Medications for muscular dystrophy include:Physical therapy Physical therapy helps keep joints and muscles flexible. It’s an important part of a muscular dystrophy treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy is to improve strength in the large muscle groups and prevent scoliosis and contractures. Physical therapy for muscular dystrophy may involve:"

If you get chalazia more than once, your doctor may recommend that you see an eye specialist such as an ophthalmologist or optometrist. They’ll want to rule out other eye problems. Treating conditions like blepharitis and meibomian gland dysfunction can keep chalazia from coming back.  ","Chalazia often go away in days or weeks without treatment. But certain things might speed the process. Medical treatment See your doctor if you think you have a chalazion. They may want to check it and tell you how to take care of it to help it heal. They can also suggest certain eye drops or creams to use. If other treatments don’t work, your doctor can prescribe medicines or give you steroid injections to help clear up the problem. In severe cases, they might need to numb the area and cut it open to drain it. Home treatment One remedy is to apply warm, moist heat to the area with a clean washcloth. Your doctor or nurse can give you instructions about how often to do it and for how long. It might also help to clean your eyelids with a mild soap, such as baby shampoo, or over-the-counter eyelid scrubs. Gently massage the area to help open the gland.

Tay-Sachs Disease,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-tay-sachs-disease,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, fatal disorder most commonly diagnosed in babies around 6 months of age. There’s no cure for the disease, but scientists have a good idea of what causes it, how it worsens, and how to use genetic testing to screen for it early in pregnancy. Researchers are working to make advances in gene therapy or bone marrow transplants that they hope will allow treatment of Tay-Sachs in the future","A baby born with Tay-Sachs grows like they should until 3 to 6 months of age. Around this time, parents might notice that their baby’s development starts to slow and their muscles weaken. Over time, the disease causes more symptoms in babies, including: A loss of motor skills such as turning over, sitting, and crawling A very strong reaction to loud noises Trouble focusing on objects or following them with their eyes Cherry-red spots, which can be identified with an eye exam, in the eyesBy age 2, most children with Tay-Sachs have started getting more serious problems. They can include: Swallowing and breathing issues that keep getting worse Seizures Loss of mental function, hearing, and sight Paralysis Past age 3, there are few visible changes in children with Tay-Sachs, but their nervous system continues to get worse, often leading to death by age 5.","Defects in a gene called HEXA cause Tay-Sachs. (You can think of genes as “coding” that your parents pass along to you. Genes are in your cells, and they set your body’s traits -- everything from your eye color and blood type to your sex.) Most people have two healthy versions of this HEXA gene, which gives instructions to your body to make an enzyme (a type of protein) known as Hex-A. This enzyme prevents the buildup of a fatty substance called GM2 ganglioside in your brain and spinal cord. Some people have just one healthy copy of the gene, and they still make enough Hex-A protein to keep the brain and spinal cord healthy. But babies born with Tay-Sachs disease got a changed copy of the gene from both parents, so they don’t make any Hex-A protein. This is what makes them so sick.Over time, GM2 ganglioside builds up in their nervous system and starts to cause damage. The disease is very rare. It affects only about 1 in every 112,000 live births. Anyone can be a carrier of a HEXA mutation, meaning they have just one defective copy of the HEXA gene. But the chance of inheriting the disease is higher in certain groups because of a higher rate of carriers. About 1 in every 27 Jewish people in the United States is a carrier. Non-Jewish French Canadians living near the St. Lawrence River in Canada and in the Cajun community of Louisiana also have a higher incidence of Tay-Sachs. If both parents are carriers of Tay-Sachs disease, there is a 25% chance that any child they have will get the disease.","Pregnant women can have a test to find out whether their unborn babies have the problem that causes Tay-Sachs. If the tests don’t find any Hex-A protein, the baby has Tay-Sachs. If the tests find Hex-A, the baby doesn’t have the disease.These tests include: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Your doctor takes a  small sample of the placenta with a needle or small tube and analyzes it. They can do this between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis. The doctor uses a needle to take a sample of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the baby and tests it. To diagnose Tay-Sachs in a baby after it’s born: Your doctor will ask you about your baby’s symptoms and your family history. They’ll do a blood test to check Hex-A levels.  The doctor will check the baby’s eyes. A cherry-red spot in the back of the eyes is a sign of Tay-Sachs. If it’s there, you may need to take your baby to specialists, such as a pediatric neurologist and an opthalmologist, for more tests.","Some of the specialists, treatments, and programs you might consider include: Speech-language pathologists. They can provide ways to help your baby keep the suck-swallow reflex going as well as help you figure out when it is time to consider a feeding tube for your little one. Neurologists. These specialists can help you manage your baby’s seizures with medication.  Respiratory health. Specialists such as pediatricians and pulmonologists (doctors who treat lung and breathing problems) can recommend ways for parents to lower their child’s chance of lung infections. Chest physiotherapy (CPT). Therapy to tap on the chest wall can help break up mucus in the lungs so your child can cough it up. Feeding tubes. Your child may have trouble swallowing or may have breathing problems that include inhaling food or liquid into their lungs while eating.

They will also need to do tests that can include:  ","Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general, or broad-spectrum, antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation.Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus like herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis.

Temporal Arteritis,https://www.webmd.com/arthritis/polymyalgia-rheumatica-temporal-arteritis,"With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids). The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.  Polymyalgia rheumatica is an infrequently occurring, inflammatory condition that causes pain or aching in the large muscle groups, especially around the shoulders and hips. Polymyalgia literally means ""many muscle pains."" Rheumatica means ""changing"" or ""in flux.""","Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:  ",,,"There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called ""steroids"" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions. Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis. Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection. The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids. While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly."
Temporary Blindness,https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/temporary-blindness-short-term-vision-loss,"It can happen if a clot creates a blockage in your retinal artery. Your doctor may call it “central retinal artery occlusion” or “branch retinal artery occlusion.” It also means you’re at risk for a stroke or heart attack. It can happen if you get a blood clot that clogs a blood vessel in the eye. It’s similar to how a clot can trigger a heart attack if plaque in your coronary arteries breaks off and forms a clot. If the same thing happened in your brain, it would be an “ischemic” (clot-triggered) stroke.Clots can cause temporary blindness in one eye, usually lasting 20 to 30 minutes. It often seems like a curtain of darkness falls (doctors call this “amaurosis fugax”). Without prompt treatment, this blockage may cause permanent blindness. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to break up the clot. Some cases need angioplasty, a procedure to reopen the blockage in the blood vessel. And it’s also a wake-up call to lower your risk of a heart attack or stroke.",,"These are very unlikely to be the cause of temporary vision loss. Retinal vein occlusionis when a vein in the retina gets blocked, often due to a blood clot. It can lead to a buildup or leak of fluid in the eye, as well as swelling. Some people have bouts of temporary vision loss leading up to this condition. It’s more likely to happen in people who have diabetes and health problems that affect blood flow, such as high blood pressure. Your doctor may inject corticosteroids to control the inflammation. You may also need another type of drug called an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor or laser treatment to cut the fluid buildup. Epileptic seizures: For about 5% to 10% of people with epilepsy, their seizures affect their occipital lobe, the part of the brain that controls vision. As a result, this disease can prompt vision loss during and after a seizure. If you have epilepsy, your doctor will recommend treatment to help prevent this and other complications.Papilledema: This is a condition where pressure in the brain causes your optic nerve to swell. This can lead to vision changes, such as double vision, blurriness, and short-term blindness. It usually lasts for a few seconds. Other symptoms include headaches and vomiting. Papilledema may be the result of a tumor, abscess, or blood clot. High blood pressure, an infection, and certain medications can also put pressure on the brain. Uhthoff phenomenon: This affects only people with multiple sclerosis (MS) -- and it’s rare even among them. MS damages nerves, and it can make them more sensitive to heat. With Uhthoff phenomenon, a rise in your body temperature worsens your symptoms. It lasts less than a day. You can lose your vision in one or both eyes. You may also feel weaker, number, or dizzier than usual. Triggers for the condition include exercise, a fever, a hot bath, sun exposure, and stress. Your MS treatment should help prevent this and other complications.You can temporarily lose your vision, totally or partially, due to another condition. The possible causes and what you should do depend on whether you can see at all. If you have sudden total, or near-total, vision loss, it’s an emergency. You need to call 911, see your eye doctor or maybe even a specialty ophthalmologist immediately, or go to an ER right away, because you have a short window of time to get it diagnosed and treated. Don’t wait to see if it goes away. If you have partial vision loss, a migraine is the most likely reason. But there are other, less common, causes that need prompt treatment to save your sight.

Thalassemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-thalassemia,"Thalassemia is an inherited blood condition. If you have it, your body has fewer red blood cells and less hemoglobin than it should. Hemoglobin is important because it lets your red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Because of this, people with this condition may have anemia, which makes you feel tired. You may hear it called things like Constant Spring, Cooley’s anemia, or hemoglobin Bart’s hydrops fetalis. These are common names for different forms of it. The two types are alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia. The terms alpha and beta refer to the part of the hemoglobin the person is lacking. There are also terms for how serious the thalassemia is. A person with a trait or minor form may not have symptoms or only mild ones. They may not need treatment. Someone with a major form will need medical treatment.","These can include: In some people, symptoms show up at birth. In others, it can take a couple of years to see anything. Some people who have thalassemia will show no signs at all.","Thalassemia is genetic. It happens when you inherit mutated genes from your parents that change your hemoglobin. You have it from birth. You can’t catch thalassemia the way you catch a cold or the flu. If both of your parents carry thalassemia, you might get it. If you inherit two or more copies of abnormal genes from your parents, you may get mild to severe thalassemia, depending on what type of protein is affected. It’s more common in people from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean countries like Greece or Turkey.","If you think you may have thalassemia, or if your parents have it, you should see a doctor. They will examine you and will ask questions. Children with moderate to severe thalassemia usually have signs by age 2. If a doctor suspects thalassemia, you’ll take blood tests. One is a CBC (complete blood count) test. The other is a hemoglobin electrophoresis test. If you are pregnant or trying to have a baby, you can have tests to learn if your baby will have the condition. If you do have thalassemia, you should see a blood expert known as a hematologist. You may also need other special doctors on your team, like those who treat the heart or liver.","If you have thalassemia, follow these habits to stay well: With a mild case, you may feel tired and not need treatment. But if it’s more serious, your organs may not get the oxygen they need. Treatment might include:Sometimes, blood transfusions cause reactions like a high fever, nausea, diarrhea, chills, and low blood pressure. If you have any of these, see your doctor. Donated blood in the U.S. is very safe. But there’s a remote chance that you could get an infection from a blood transfusion. Work closely with your doctor, and keep up with your treatments."
Thiamine Deficiency,https://www.webmd.com/brain/wernicke-korsakoff-syndrome-facts,"Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is one name for two conditions that often happen together -- Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome. Many doctors think of them as different stages of the same disease. They can happen if you don’t get enough vitamin B1, also called thiamine. Vitamin B1 helps your brain turn sugar into energy. When your brain and nervous system don’t get the amount they need, they don’t work as well. Wernicke encephalopathy typically comes on suddenly, and you’ll need treatment right away. Symptoms include confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and trouble with your vision. Korsakoff syndrome happens more slowly. It’s a long-term, ongoing problem that damages the part of your brain that handles memory.","The main signs of Wernicke encephalopathy are:You also may have problems with your heart and blood vessels that can lead to: If you aren’t treated for Wernicke encephalopathy quickly, it can lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome usually begin as the signs of Wernicke encephalopathy start to go away. The telltale sign is the loss of short-term memory. That also makes it hard for you to learn anything new or make new memories. You might talk to someone and seem like yourself. But a minute or two later, you won’t remember anything about it, not even who you spoke with. You may also have:  ","In many cases, the lack of vitamin B1 is caused by heavy, long-term alcohol use.

They include: Pain in the neck, shoulder, or arm Numbness and tingling Swelling Weakness Discoloration -- blue, red, or pale Cold hands Atrophy (when the tissue or muscle in your arm starts to waste away)  Weak pulse in your affected arm Painful lump near your collarbone Shrinking of the muscle in the fleshy base of your thumb (also called Gilliatt-Sumner hand)  ","There are several causes: Injuries:Whiplash, a broken collarbone, or other injury can leave scar tissue and inflammation. Poor posture: When your shoulders slump, your collarbones can move out of place and press on your nerves. Weak shoulder muscles can cause bad posture. Repetitive stress: It can affect people who move their arms in a certain way over and over again. Physical defects: Some people are born with an extra rib or a thoracic outlet that’s smaller than normal. Obesity: Extra weight can put stress on the muscles that support your collarbones. Pregnancy: TOS can happen as your joints begin to get looser. Sleep disorders Tumors, especially in your upper chest or under your arm Stress or depressionTOS is found more often in women than in men and primarily in young people, mostly ages 20-40. Athletes who move their arms in the same way a lot, like swimmers or baseball pitchers, also can be more likely to have it.  ","Your doctor will start by asking questions to get a detailed history of your symptoms and then do a physical exam. Neurogenic: This type isn’t always easy to spot. Things can compress the nerves that serve your arms and hands in different places for a variety of reasons. The symptoms will be the same, but the problem could be arthritis in your neck, a pinched nerve, or carpal tunnel syndrome. Other conditions like a damaged rotator cuff, fibromyalgia, and multiple sclerosis can cause pain and numbness in your shoulders and arms. Another example is thinning or wasting of the muscle at the base of the thumb. This can happen with carpal tunnel syndrome too.Venous and arterial: These symptoms are more obvious. Blood doesn’t circulate properly. You may even have a blood clot. Your arm or hand may be swollen, and look either pale or bluish. You may have a weak pulse or no pulse in the affected arm. Several kinds of tests can help with the diagnosis: Positioning tests: The doctor will move your arms and head in different ways to see if the symptoms appear. One shortfall: These tests can also cause symptoms in healthy people. Scalene muscle block: The doctor will give you a shot that relaxes muscles in this area to see if that makes the symptoms go away. Imaging tests: An X-ray, CT scan, or MRI can reveal an extra rib or other abnormal physical feature. An ultrasound can look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels. Nerve tests: Results are usually normal in people with this condition, but they can rule out other causes. Blood circulation tests: An arteriogram or venogram (tests that use dyes and X-rays to see how blood flows in your system) can show blood clots or other damage to blood vessels.","Management of TOS depends on the type. Neurogenic: The usual treatments are: Physical therapy: You’ll do exercises to stretch and strengthen muscles in your neck and shoulders and improve your posture. This may be all you need to get relief. Medication: The doctor may recommend that you use a muscle relaxant or that you take ibuprofen or naproxen to ease pain and swelling. You may hear your doctor call these NSAIDS, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Botox shots: A shot into the muscle at the base of your neck can relax the area and help ease pain. This can work for up to 3 months and be repeated if you need it. Surgery is sometimes an option, but it doesn’t work nearly as well for this type of TOS. Venous and arterial: First you’ll be treated for any possible blood clots. Then you’ll most likely need a type of surgery called thoracic outlet decompression. Your surgeon will open up the space for the nerves and blood vessels to pass through. They may remove extra bone or other tissue, and cut or remove muscles that are causing the compression. They’ll also fix or bypass damaged blood vessels.If other treatments don’t fix your symptoms, you may need long-term pain management. You may need medication.  Your doctor also may recommend a few things you can do to feel better: Get to a healthy weight. Set up your workstation to support good posture.  Avoid things that aggravate the condition, like carrying a heavy bag on your shoulder. Take breaks often at work to move and stretch. Try a massage or a heating pad on your muscles. Do relaxation exercises, like visualization, autogenic relaxation (repeating a word that gives you peace), or progressive muscle relaxation (clinching then releasing different muscles).   "

Some experts think that certain chemicals in tobacco might irritate your blood vessels, and that’s what makes them swell. Others think tobacco triggers your immune system to attack your blood vessels like they’re bad germs.","No single test can check for Buerger’s disease. Your doctor will start by asking about your tobacco use and your symptoms. They may do tests to check your blood flow and rule out other diseases that cause similar symptoms. For example, peripheral artery disease also causes pain in your legs, but it’s caused by plaque building up in your arteries, not inflammation. You may also have:  ","Quitting tobacco is the only way to limit the effects of Buerger’s disease. Even a few cigarettes a day can make it worse. Other treatments may help boost blood flow and ease pain, including: Your doctor might need to cut off part or all of an area with infection or gangrene (amputation). Researchers are also studying other treatments. Proteins called growth factors might speed healing and ease pain. Injections of stem cells, which can grow into other kinds of cells, may help your body make new blood vessels."

Thyroid Disorders,https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-thyroid-problems-basics,"Through the hormones it produces, the thyroid gland influences almost all of the metabolic processes in your body. Thyroid disorders can range from a small, harmless goiter (enlarged gland) that needs no treatment to life-threatening cancer. The most common thyroid problems involve abnormal production of thyroid hormones. Too much thyroid hormone results in a condition known as hyperthyroidism. Insufficient hormone production leads to hypothyroidism.Although the effects can be unpleasant or uncomfortable, most thyroid problems can be managed well if properly diagnosed and treated. ",,"All types of hyperthyroidism are due to an overproduction of thyroid hormones, but the condition can occur in several ways: Hypothyroidism, by contrast, stems from an underproduction of thyroid hormones. Since your body's energy production requires certain amounts of thyroid hormones, a drop in hormone production leads to lower energy levels. Causes of hypothyroidism include:Untreated for long periods of time, hypothyroidism can bring on a myxedema coma, a rare but potentially fatal condition that requires immediate hormone treatment. Hypothyroidism poses a special danger to newborns and infants. A lack of thyroid hormones in the system at an early age can lead to the development of cretinism (intellectual disability) and dwarfism (stunted growth). Most infants now have their thyroid levels checked routinely soon after birth. If they are hypothyroid, treatment begins immediately. In infants, as in adults, hypothyroidism can be due to these causes: A hypothyroid infant is unusually inactive and quiet, has a poor appetite, and sleeps for excessively long periods of time. Cancer of the thyroid gland is quite rare and occurs in about 5% of thyroid nodules. You might have one or more thyroid nodules for several years before they are determined to be cancerous.

It would be like having a clogged fuel line in your car. Your engine can't run if it's not getting gas. Clots form when you have a buildup of a fatty, waxy substance called plaque in your arteries. They can take shape anywhere in your body and float along until they get stuck somewhere. If that ""somewhere"" happens to be an artery that goes to your brain, you can have a TIA.

Tic Douloureux,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tic-douloureux,"Tic douloureux or trigeminal neuralgia is a severe, stabbing pain to one side of the face. It stems from one or more branches of the nerve that supplies sensation to the face, the trigeminal nerve. It is considered one of the most painful conditions to affect people. The pain usually lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes. It may be so intense that you wince involuntarily, hence the term tic. There is usually no pain or numbness between attacks and no dysfunction of the muscles of the face. Most people feel the pain in their jaw, cheek, or lip on one side of the face only. Pain is usually triggered by a light touch of the face or mouth on the same side as the pain. The pain is so severe that people can become afraid to talk, eat, or move during periods of attacks. Although a flurry of attacks can last for weeks or months, there are usually periods of months or even years that are symptom-free. The pain of tic douloureux is usually controlled with medications or surgery. Tic douloureux is generally a disease of middle age or later life. Women are affected more often than men. People with multiple sclerosis are affected much more frequently than the general population.  ","The main symptom of tic douloureux is a sudden, severe, stabbing, sharp, shooting, electric-shock-like pain on one side of the face. Because the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve are the most commonly affected, the pain is usually felt in the lower half of the face.The pain comes in intermittent episodes that last from a few seconds to a few minutes. There may be many episodes of pain each day. There is usually no pain between episodes.","The cause of tic douloureux is unknown. There are a number of theories as to why the trigeminal nerve is affected. The most commonly accepted theory is compression of the trigeminal nerve, usually by a blood vessel, causing it to become irritated. This irritation causes the outer covering of the nerve (the myelin sheath) to erode over time. The irritated nerve then becomes more excitable and erratically fires pain impulses. Tumors and bony abnormalities of the skull may also press on and irritate the trigeminal nerve. In addition, trauma, infections, and multiple sclerosis can also damage the trigeminal nerve.","There is no single medical test to diagnose tic douloureux. The diagnosis is made based on the description of the pain, physical examination, and exclusion of other causes of facial pain. The pain is unique. A history of bursts of shooting pain in one side of the face along with a trigger zone will give the doctor good clues to the cause of your pain. The physical examination is normal in tic douloureux. If numbness, decreased hearing, dizziness, visual changes, or dysfunction of the muscles of the face is found, then other disorders may be considered. Additionally, other causes of facial pain such as a sinus infection, dental infection, or a jaw disorder, such as TMJ, can often be found by physical examination. Special X-ray images, such as a CT scan or MRI of the head, can look for other causes of facial pain. They can also help delineate blood vessels or tumors that might be pressing on the nerve and irritating it.","There are no effective home treatment remedies for tic douloureux. Treatment should be guided by a physician. The role of the doctor is to ensure the diagnosis, begin appropriate therapy, and coordinate any potential need for consultants. In most cases, effective treatment will require only medications. Uncommonly, surgery will be recommended. The primary treatment of tic douloureux is medication to control the pain. Surgery may be necessary when drug therapy is not effective or side effects from the medications are not tolerable. A number of medications can be effective in helping control the pain of tic douloureux. The most commonly prescribed medications are anticonvulsants (seizure medications). Anticonvulsants help to stop the irritated trigeminal nerve from firing pain impulses.Medication is at least partly effective for most people who suffer with tic douloureux. For the rest, drug therapy either fails to provide adequate pain control or adverse side effects are intolerable. Unfortunately, many people who initially respond to anticonvulsants eventually develop resistance to the medications. Surgery When pain cannot be controlled with medication, surgical options should be discussed with a neurosurgeon. Surgery could range from simple injections of anesthetic into the trigeminal nerve to complex procedures that must be performed in the operating room. In general, the more complex procedures provide longer-lasting pain relief but with greater potential for more serious complications.  "
Tick Bites,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/is-that-a-tick-bite,"Ticks aren’t like bugs that bite you and then fly away or scoot off. When one gets on your body, it sets up camp. It finds a place to eat, then burrows its head into your skin and starts feeding. And it’ll stay there for several days. Most likely, you won’t feel anything because the bite doesn’t hurt, and it isn’t usually itchy. Because ticks are often very small, you might not see it either. At first, it might just look like a fleck of dirt. As it feeds though, it swells up and can be easier to find.You might get a small red bump where the tick bites you. Some people’s bodies react to ticks with 1 to 2 inches of redness around the bite. That red area won’t get any bigger, unless it’s really a rash, which is a sign of disease. Ticks typically bite people in warm, moist, or hairy areas, like the: Once a tick finds a place to feed, it will stay there anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks. Ticks bite once and use that site to feed on your blood until they’re full. A tick will fall off on its own once it’s full. You won’t get multiple bites from a tick. Most tick bites are painless and cause only a minor reaction. Only sometimes do they transmit disease.","Tick bites often cause a reaction on your skin, even when they’re not infected or disease-causing. Typical symptoms of a tick bite may include:Unlike other bites, tick bites don’t usually have fluid or pus in them, unless they’re infected. Most diseases from ticks also give you flu-like symptoms, such as: With Lyme disease, you may also have joint pain. Only some diseases from ticks give you a rash. What it looks like depends on which kind you have. Lyme disease: Most people with Lyme disease get a rash, but not all of them. It shows up within 3-30 days after you were bitten, but it usually takes just over a week. You’ll see a round or oval area of redness around the bite. At first, it may look just like a reaction to the bite, but the rash gets bigger over days or even weeks. Typically, it reaches about 6 inches wide. It might feel warm, but it’s not usually painful or itchy. Most people think of the bull’s-eye rash when they hear about Lyme disease. That happens in less than half the cases, and it comes after the rash has been around for a while.",,,"If you find a tick still on your skin, follow these steps: It’s important to start treatment for diseases from ticks as soon as possible. If your tick bite is infected or you’ve gotten a disease from it, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics to help get rid of the infection or disease. "

They can seem like angina, which is chest pain when your heart muscles don't get enough blood. They are also very similar to certain lung problems and costochondritis, also called chest wall pain. Because there is no special test for Tietze syndrome, doctors usually want to know about your symptoms. Your doctor will probably do a physical exam which could involve pressing on your chest. They may also order tests to rule out other things. These tests might include X-rays, an ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a biopsy, or an electrocardiogram to see the electrical activity in your heart.","The symptoms of Tietze syndrome usually aren't serious and often will go away with no treatment. Sometimes just hearing from your doctor that it’s Tietze syndrome and not a heart attack can reassure you enough to deal with the pain until it goes away on its own. Other treatments can help ease the pain and swelling. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin. Talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking any medicine, even over-the-counter medicine. This is because it may interact with medication you're already taking, or make other health conditions worse. If your pain is really bad, your doctor might recommend corticosteroid injections right into your joint area to reduce pain and swelling. You can only do this a couple of times without risking damage to your joint. Other things that may help are lots of rest, no heavy physical activity for a while, and applying heat or ice to the painful area."

Toe Fracture,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/did-i-break-a-toe,"A broken toe is when you break a bone in one of your toes. Each of your toes has three bones, except for the big toe, which has two. A break can happen when you stub your toe really hard or drop something on it. A broken toe doesn’t usually need much medical care. In fact, it can be tough to tell whether you broke it or just hurt it badly, and the treatment’s often the same.","When you break a toe, you’ll likely have: ",,"First, your doctor will ask you what happened and what symptoms you’re having. They’ll check for tenderness and broken skin around your toe. They’ll also test your nerves and blood flow. Then, if your doctor thinks it’s a break, you’ll likely get an X-ray.","Treatment depends on where and how bad the break is. In most cases, you’ll be sent home with directions for self-care. You may also get a prescription for pain medicine. It helps you heal if you can keep your toe from bending too much. Your doctor might suggest buddy taping. That’s where you tape your broken toe to the toe next to it. First, you first put cotton or gauze between your toes so the skin doesn’t rub and get raw. Then, you wrap them with medical tape. You doctor may also give you a stiff-bottomed shoe with a cloth top. This keeps your toe from bending too much and allows room for swelling. If you broke your toe all the way through and the bone moved, your doctor may need to set it back in place. First, you’ll get a shot to numb your toe. Then your doctor moves the bones back together with their hands. There’s no surgery involved. You may get a cast if the bone pieces don’t stay in place.If you have a wound, you may also get antibiotics and a tetanus shot. If you have blood trapped under your toenail, your doctor will try to drain it but may have to remove the nail completely. For very serious breaks, you may need surgery to put in pins or screws that hold the bones in place."

Tooth Decay,https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/tooth-decay-prevention,"  Researchers are developing new means to prevent tooth decay. One study found that a chewing gum that contains the sweetener xylitol temporarily retarded the growth of bacteria that cause tooth decay. In addition, several materials that slowly release fluoride over time, which will help prevent further decay, are being explored. These materials would be placed between teeth or in pits and fissures of teeth. Toothpastes and mouth rinses that can reverse and ""heal"" early cavities are also being studied.        Tooth decay is the destruction of tooth structure and can affect both the enamel (the outer coating of the tooth) and the dentin layer of the tooth.   Tooth decay occurs when foods containing carbohydrates (sugars and starches), such as breads, cereals, milk, soda, fruits, cakes, or candy are left on the teeth. Bacteria that live in the mouth digest these foods, turning them into acids. The bacteria, acid, food debris, and saliva combine to form plaque, which clings to the teeth. The acids in plaque dissolve the enamel surface of the teeth, creating holes in the teeth called cavities.   To prevent tooth decay:  ",,,,

How sick your baby can get depends on several things, including what the condition is and how far along they are in their development. But a number of problems can happen -- from jaundice (yellowish skin or eyes) and hearing problems to miscarriage and stillbirth.",,,,
Torn Rotator Cuff,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/what-is-my-rotator-cuff,Your rotator cuff is made up of muscles and tendons that keep the ball (head) of your upper-arm bone (humerus) in your shoulder socket.

Torsion Dystonia,https://www.webmd.com/brain/dystonia-causes-types-symptoms-and-treatments,"Symptoms of dystonia can range from very mild to severe. Dystonia can affect different body parts, and often the symptoms of dystonia progress through stages. Some early symptoms include: Stress or fatigue may bring on the symptoms or cause them to worsen. People with dystonia often complain of pain and exhaustion because of the constant muscle contractions. If dystonia symptoms occur in childhood, they generally appear first in the foot or hand. But then they quickly progress to the rest of the body. After adolescence, though, the progression rate tends to slow down. When dystonia appears in early adulthood, it typically begins in the upper body. Then there is a slow progression of symptoms. Dystonias that start in early adulthood remain focal or segmental: They affect either one part of the body or two or more adjacent body parts.","Symptoms of dystonia can range from very mild to severe.

Dystonias that start in early adulthood remain focal or segmental: They affect either one part of the body or two or more adjacent body parts.",Most cases of dystonia do not have a specific cause. Dystonia seems to be related to a problem in the basal ganglia. That's the area of the brain that is responsible for initiating muscle contractions. The problem involves the way the nerve cells communicate. Acquired dystonia is caused by damage to the basal ganglia. The damage could be the result of: Idiopathic or primary dystonia is often inherited from a parent. Some carriers of the disorder may never develop a dystonia themselves. And the symptoms may vary widely among members of the same family.,,"There are several options for treating dystonia. The doctor will determine the course of treatment based on the type of dystonia and its severity. A recently introduced treatment is botulinum toxin, also called Botox or Xeomin. The toxin is injected into the affected muscle. There it blocks the effect of the chemical acetylcholine that produces muscle contractions. The injection needs to be repeated about every three months. When dystonia causes someone to become disabled, deep brain stimulation is an option. With deep brain stimulation, an electrode is implanted into a particular area in the brain. It is then connected to a battery powered stimulator implanted in the chest. The electrode transmits electrical pulses created by the stimulator to the brain region to reduce the muscular contractions. The person's doctor regulates the frequency and intensity of the electrical pulses. Medications can help reduce the ""overdrive"" messages that cause muscles to contract excessively in dystonia. Drugs used include:Sensory trick is another option. With sensory trick, stimulation applied to the affected or nearby body part may reduce the muscular contractions. By simply touching this area, people can control their own contractions. Speech therapy, physical therapy, and stress management may also be used to treat the symptoms of dystonia.  Dystonia is a movement disorder in which a person's muscles contract uncontrollably. The contraction causes the affected body part to twist involuntarily, resulting in repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Dystonia can affect one muscle, a muscle group, or the entire body. Dystonia affects about 1% of the population, and women are more prone to it than men."
Torticollis,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-is-torticollis,"You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM. When your baby has torticollis, this ropy muscle is shortened on one side. Why does the muscle become shortened? Your baby might have been cramped in the womb or may have been in an abnormal position, such as a breech position. That can put extra pressure on one side of your infant’s head, which can cause the SCM to tighten. If your doctor used forceps or a vacuum device during delivery, those also might have put pressure on your baby’s SCM.",You may not notice anything unusual about your baby for the first 6 or 8 weeks. It’s common for torticollis symptoms to become obvious once an infant gains more control of the head and neck. Some of the symptoms you might see:,"You have a long muscle on each side of your neck that runs from the back of your ear to your collarbone. It is called the sternocleidomastoid, or SCM.

Once torticollis is diagnosed and stretching exercises start, most babies improve within 6 months. Two things can speed recovery: an early diagnosis and sticking to the treatment plan. Very rarely, children with torticollis will need surgery to lengthen the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Doctors will usually wait until your child is a preschooler to consider this option.Torticollis is a problem involving the muscles of the neck that causes the head to tilt down. The term comes from two Latin words: tortus, which means twisted, and collum, which means neck. Sometimes it’s called “wryneck.” If your baby has the condition at birth, it’s called congenital muscular torticollis. That’s the most common type. Babies can also develop the condition after birth. Then it’s called “acquired,” rather than congenital. Acquired torticollis may be linked to other, more serious medical issues."
Torular Meningitis,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-meningitis-basics,Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it.    ,"Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days and may include:Symptoms of meningitis in infants In infants, meningitis symptoms may include:  ","Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include:  ","Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam, including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. They will also need to do tests that can include:  ","Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general, or broad-spectrum, antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation.Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus like herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. There is a possibility of being hospitalized if you are dehydrated or have severe symptoms.  "
Tourette's Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/brain/tourettes-syndrome,"Tourette's syndrome is a problem with the nervous system that causes people to make sudden movements or sounds, called tics, that they can't control. For example, someone with Tourette's might blink or clear their throat over and over again. Some people may blurt out words they don't intend to say. Treatments can control tics, but some people don’t need any unless their symptoms really bother them. About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome, but more people have a milder form of the disease. It often starts in childhood, and more boys than girls get it. Symptoms often get better as children grow up. For some people, they go away completely.","The main symptom is tics. Some are so mild they're not even noticeable. Others happen often and are obvious. Stress, excitement, or being sick or tired can make them worse. The more severe ones can be embarrassing and can affect your social life or work. There are two types of tics: Motor tics involve movement. They include: Vocal tics include: Tics can be simple or complex. A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. A complex one involves many parts of the body or saying words. Jumping and swearing are examples.Before a motor tic, you may get a sensation that can feel like a tingle or tension. The movement makes the sensation go away. You might be able to hold your tics back for a little while, but you probably can't stop them from happening. Doctors aren’t sure why, but about half of people with Tourette's also have symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). You may have trouble paying attention, sitting still, and finishing tasks. Tourette’s can also cause problems with:","Tourette's has been linked to different parts of the brain, including an area called the basal ganglia, which helps control body movements. Differences there may affect nerve cells and the chemicals that carry messages between them. Researchers think the trouble in this brain network may play a role in Tourette's.Doctors don't know exactly what causes these problems in the brain, but genes probably play a role. It's likely that there is more than one cause. People who have family members with Tourette's are more likely to get it themselves. But people in the same family may have different symptoms.","If you or your child has symptoms of Tourette's, your doctor may want you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats diseases of the nervous system. There aren't any tests for the condition, but they'll ask you questions, like: Your doctor may do imaging tests of your brain to rule out other conditions that have symptoms like those of Tourette's. They might include:","Many times, tics are mild and don't need to be treated. If they become a problem, your doctor may prescribe medicine to help them. It can take a while to find the right dose that helps control tics but avoids side effects, so be patient as you and your doctor work through it. Medications can include:Along with medicine, you may want to consider talk therapy. A psychologist or counselor can help you learn how to deal with the social issues your tics and other symptoms may cause. Behavior therapy may also help. A specific kind, called habit-reversal training, teaches you how to recognize that a tic is coming and then move in a way that stops it."

Toxic Shock Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/understanding-toxic-shock-syndrome-basics,"Toxic shock syndrome is a sudden, potentially fatal condition. It's caused by the release of toxins from an overgrowth of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus, or staph, which is found in many women's bodies. Toxic shock syndrome affects menstruating women, especially those who use super-absorbent tampons. The body responds to the infection with a sharp drop in blood pressure that deprives organs of oxygen and can lead to death. This disease made headlines in the late 1970s and early 1980s after the deaths of several young women who were using a brand of super-absorbent tampon that was later removed from the market. Toxic shock syndrome is still mostly a disease of menstruating women who use tampons. But it has also been linked to the use of menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps. A woman who has recently given birth also has a higher chance of getting toxic shock. And it can happen to men and women who have been exposed to staph bacteria while recovering from surgery, a burn, an open wound, or the use of a prosthetic device.More than one-third of all cases of toxic shock involve women under 19, and up to 30% of women who have had the disease will get it again. If you have ever had toxic shock, you must look out for the symptoms so you can get immediate medical care. People who die from toxic shock are killed by the body's response to the toxins released by staph bacteria. Most people suffer hypotensive shock, in which the heart and lungs stop working.","Some signs and symptoms of toxic shock syndrome to look out for include: If you’re menstruating and have a high fever with vomiting, especially if you‘ve been using tampons, you must get medical help right away. If you’re using a tampon, menstrual sponge, diaphragm, or cervical cap when you get ill, remove it immediately, even before calling your doctor.","Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a poison produced by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. This bacteria is one of several staph bacteria that cause skin infections in burn patients and hospital patients who have had surgery. Staph is normally -- and harmlessly -- present in the vagina. Doctors don’t know how toxins cause toxic shock syndrome. But two conditions are necessary: First, the bacteria need an environment in which they can grow rapidly and release poisons. Then the poisons must get into the bloodstream. A tampon saturated with blood is a supportive place for rapid growth of bacteria. It also seems to matter what the tampon is made of. Polyester foam provides a better environment for the growth of bacteria than either cotton or rayon fibers. In some cases resulting from menstrual sponges, diaphragms, and cervical caps, the device had been in the vagina for a long time -- more than 30 hours. In the case of sponges alone, pieces of the sponge remained in the vagina.The way in which bacterial poisons enter the bloodstream may also be related to tampon use. Sliding a tampon into place could make microscopic tears in your vaginal walls, rupturing tiny blood vessels. Leaving a super-absorbent tampon in too long or using it when your flow is light can dry out your vagina. This makes tearing even more likely. Researchers investigating toxic shock syndrome causes have ruled out feminine deodorant sprays and douches, underwear, and other clothing. The condition is also unrelated to your menstrual history, drug or alcohol use, cigarette smoking, swimming or bathing, or sexual activity.",There are several ways that doctors test for toxic shock syndrome:,"If you have toxic shock syndrome, you’ll most likely need to go to the hospital where you could receive:"
Toxoplasmosis,https://www.webmd.com/baby/toxoplasmosis,"Toxoplasmosis is an infection caused by a parasite called Toxoplasma gondii. You can find it in the intestines of some animals, including cats and pigs. The infection can cause cysts to form in your body, usually in your brain and muscles, including your heart. But if your immune system is healthy, it isn’t likely to cause you any trouble. You can have toxoplasmosis without knowing it. It’s more likely to cause problems in people whose immune systems aren’t at full strength because of a health problem like HIV, or some types of cancer or cancer treatments. It also can be harmful to babies as they develop in the womb -- a pregnant woman can pass it to their baby. It can cause issues with the brain or eyes.","Toxoplasmosis symptoms in babies Babies may get toxoplasmosis if the mother has been infected just before or during the pregnancy, even if they don’t have signs of the disease. Many early infections end in stillbirth or miscarriage. If the baby survives, they may have serious problems like:Often, babies with toxoplasmosis don’t show any signs of it at birth. The symptoms (like hearing loss, mental disability, or severe eye infections) show up in the teen years. Toxoplasmosis symptoms in older children and adults Symptoms of toxoplasmosis can feel a lot like the flu. They include: If your immune system isn’t working like it should because of another health problem, you also may have more serious symptoms, such as:",You might come into contact with the parasite if you: You also could be exposed to it if you’re an organ donor or have had a blood transfusion.,"If you have signs of toxoplasmosis, see your doctor. You also might want to talk with them about it if you want to get pregnant or you have a health problem that affects your immune system. If you have the infection, your body will make things called antibodies to try to fight it off. To find out if you have toxoplasmosis, your doctor can do a blood test to see if you have those antibodies. If you’ve been infected recently, your body may not have had time to make them. So even if your test doesn’t show any signs of them, your doctor may want to do another test a few weeks later to be sure. If the blood test shows you do have the antibodies, you’re likely in for another test. The CDC recommends that a lab that specializes in toxoplasmosis test your blood sample again to make sure the result is correct. If so, more tests can be done on your blood to find out when the infection started. If you have a serious illness such as encephalitis (a life-threatening brain infection), you may need imaging tests to check for cysts or lesions in your brain. These tests may include an MRI or a brain biopsy. With an MRI, you lie inside a machine that creates images of your brain and head using a magnetic field and radio waves. With a brain biopsy, a doctor takes a sample of brain tissue and has it checked for toxoplasmosis cysts.  ","Toxoplasmosis doesn’t cause problems for most people, so you probably won’t need treatment for it if your immune system is healthy. If you are HIV-positive  or have AIDS, your doctor may recommend the antibiotic sulfadiazine, along with a medication usually used to treat malaria  called pyrimethamine (Daraprim). For a pregnant woman whose baby hasn’t been affected, the doctor might prescribe an antibiotic called spiramycin. It’s used to treat toxoplasmosis in Europe but is still being tested in the United States. If your baby is also infected or is likely to be, the doctor may recommend sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, but only after the 16th week of pregnancy. Your doctor will watch the baby closely for signs of problems."

But, these medicines can cause side effects (some may be severe). Always talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the medications you are prescribed. Severe, stubborn symptoms can be hard to treat and may keep coming back. This could mean you need long-term treatment. Your doctor may prescribe light therapy combined with medications if this happens. Other treatments that may be used for severe symptoms are:Your doctor may also suggest you reduce activities that can cause a lot of sweating (like heavy-duty workouts), since sweating can worsen the rash.

Traumatic Brain Injury (Concussion),https://www.webmd.com/brain/concussion-traumatic-brain-injury-symptoms-causes-treatments,"The most common and least serious type of traumatic brain injury is called a concussion. The word comes from the Latin concutere, which means ""to shake violently."" A concussion is most often caused by a sudden direct blow or bump to the head. According to the CDC, between 2001 and 2009, an estimated 173,285 people under age 19 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for concussions related to sports and recreation activities. Other causes include car and bicycle accidents, work-related injuries, falls, and fighting.","Concussions can be tricky to diagnose. Though you may have a visible cut or bruise on your head, you can't see a concussion. Signs may not appear for days or weeks after the injury. Some symptoms last for just seconds; others may linger. Concussions are fairly common. Some estimates say a mild brain trauma is sustained every 21 seconds in the U.S. But it's important to recognize the signs of a concussion so you can take the proper steps to treat the injury. There are some common physical, mental, and emotional symptoms a person may display following a concussion. Signs of traumatic brain injury include:","The brain is made of soft tissue. It's cushioned by spinal fluid and encased in the protective shell of the skull. When you have a blow or bump to your head, the impact can jolt your brain. Sometimes, it literally causes it to move around in your head. Traumatic brain injuries can cause bruising, damage to the blood vessels, and injury to the nerves. The result is your brain doesn't function as it should. If you've had a concussion, vision may be disturbed, you may lose equilibrium, or you may fall unconscious. In short, the brain is confused. Some things increase your risk for a concussion, including:","Most people with concussions fully recover with appropriate treatment. But because a concussion can be serious, safeguarding yourself is important. Here are a few steps to take:Seek medical attention. A health care professional can decide how serious the concussion is and whether you require treatment. They’ll ask how the head injury happened and discuss the symptoms. The doctor may also ask you simple questions such as ""Where do you live?,"" ""What is your name?,"" or ""Who is the president?""

This is especially relevant for pregnant women and children. Pepto-Bismol (2 ounces four times daily or two tablets four times daily) decreases the diarrhea and shortens the duration of the illness. This medication also appears to be effective in preventing traveler's diarrhea, but it should not be taken for more than three weeks at a time. Side effects of Pepto-Bismol can include temporary blackening of tongue and stools, occasional nausea, constipation, and rarely, ringing in the ears. Do not take Pepto-Bismol if you have an aspirin allergy, renal insufficiency, gout, or if you are taking anticoagulants, probenecid (Benemid, Probalan), or methotrexate (Rheumatrex). The most important treatment requires the replacement of fluids and salts lost from diarrhea. This is best achieved by use of an oral rehydration solution such as the World Health Organization oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. ORS packets are available at stores or pharmacies in almost all developing countries.ORS is prepared by adding one packet to boiled or treated water. Packet instructions should be followed carefully to ensure that the salts are added to the correct volume of water. ORS solution should be consumed or discarded within 12 hours if stored at room temperature or within 24 hours if refrigerated. An antidiarrheal medication, such as Lomotil or Imodium, can decrease the number of diarrheal stools but can also cause complications for people with serious infections. These drugs should not be used by anyone with a high fever or blood in their stools. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), norfloxacin (Noroxin), rifamycin (Aemcolo), and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Bactrim, Septra), may shorten the length of illness. The CDC does not recommend the use of  most antibiotics to prevent traveler's diarrhea, with the exception of rifaximin (Xifaxan), because they can sometimes cause additional problems. Azithromycin (Zithromax) is typically used to treat traveler's diarrhea. Consult your doctor about taking these medications. It is important for an infected person to consult a doctor about treating diarrhea in children and infants, because some of the drugs mentioned above are not recommended for children. The greatest risk for children, especially infants, is dehydration. Again, the best treatment for dehydration is the ORS solution. Breastfed infants should continue nursing on demand. For bottle-fed infants, full-strength lactose-free or lactose-reduced formulas should be used. Be sure to mix the formula with boiled water that has cooled. Older children receiving semisolid or solid foods should continue to receive usual foods if they have diarrhea. Immediate medical attention is required if an infant with diarrhea develops signs of moderate to severe dehydration (including dry mouth, eyes, and skin), confusion; sunken eyes; and fever, bloody diarrhea, persistent vomiting, or fever higher than 102 F."

Trichomoniasis,https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/guide/trichomoniasis,"Trichomoniasis, also called trich, is a common sexually transmitted disease (STD). Trich is caused by a tiny one-celled parasite named Trichomonas vaginalis. Anyone who’s sexually active can get it. It affects women more than men, older women more than younger ones, and African American women more than white or Hispanic women. People with trich often don’t have any symptoms, and it doesn’t usually cause problems. But if you don’t get treatment, it raises your chances of getting or spreading other STDs, including HIV.","About 70% of people with trich don’t have symptoms. In others, the signs might not show up until days or weeks after infection. Women with trichomoniasis may have: Men with trichomoniasis may have:  ","You get trich by having sex with someone who has it. Typically, it spreads through contact between a penis and a vagina. Women who have sex with women can also get trich through vaginal contact. Women typically get the infection in their vulva, vagina, cervix, or urethra. Men usually get it in their urethra. They may also get it in their prostate, the gland between the bladder and the penis. It’s rare to have trich in other parts of your body, such as your hands, mouth, or anus. Anyone who has trich can spread it, even if they don’t have symptoms.","Doctors can diagnose trich by taking a sample of pee or fluid from your genitals and looking at it under a microscope to spot the parasite. Sometimes, they might need to do a test called a culture. This is when they store the sample for several days so the parasite can grow and be easier to find under a microscope. Sensitive tests called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can also spot signs of the parasite. Your doctor might test you for other STDs at the same time because many people with trich also have gonorrhea or chlamydia.","Antibiotic medications like metronidazole (Flagyl, Noritate, Nuvessa) and tinidazole (Tindamax) clear up the infection in most people. Your doctor will give you pills to swallow, either in one large dose or in several smaller doses. Take all of the medicine, even if you start to feel better before you’re done. Treatment will get rid of the parasite, but you can still get it again. About 20% of people get trich again within 3 months of treatment. Your sex partner or partners should also be treated, even if they don’t have symptoms. Don’t have sex for 7 to 10 days after treatment. Your doctor might want to test you again before you have sex."
Trichotillomania,https://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/trichotillomania,"Trichotillomania, also known as “hair-pulling disorder,” is a type of impulse control disorder. People who have trichotillomania have an irresistible urge to pull out their hair, usually from their scalp, eyelashes, and eyebrows. They know they can do damage but often can’t control the impulse. They may pull out their hair when they're stressed as a way to try to soothe themselves. Trichotillomania is a type of impulse control disorder.

Trigeminal Neuralgia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/tic-douloureux,"Tic douloureux or trigeminal neuralgia is a severe, stabbing pain to one side of the face. It stems from one or more branches of the nerve that supplies sensation to the face, the trigeminal nerve. It is considered one of the most painful conditions to affect people. The pain usually lasts from a few seconds to a few minutes. It may be so intense that you wince involuntarily, hence the term tic. There is usually no pain or numbness between attacks and no dysfunction of the muscles of the face. Most people feel the pain in their jaw, cheek, or lip on one side of the face only. Pain is usually triggered by a light touch of the face or mouth on the same side as the pain. The pain is so severe that people can become afraid to talk, eat, or move during periods of attacks. Although a flurry of attacks can last for weeks or months, there are usually periods of months or even years that are symptom-free. The pain of tic douloureux is usually controlled with medications or surgery. Tic douloureux is generally a disease of middle age or later life. Women are affected more often than men. People with multiple sclerosis are affected much more frequently than the general population.  ","The main symptom of tic douloureux is a sudden, severe, stabbing, sharp, shooting, electric-shock-like pain on one side of the face. Because the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve are the most commonly affected, the pain is usually felt in the lower half of the face.The pain comes in intermittent episodes that last from a few seconds to a few minutes. There may be many episodes of pain each day. There is usually no pain between episodes.","The cause of tic douloureux is unknown. There are a number of theories as to why the trigeminal nerve is affected. The most commonly accepted theory is compression of the trigeminal nerve, usually by a blood vessel, causing it to become irritated. This irritation causes the outer covering of the nerve (the myelin sheath) to erode over time. The irritated nerve then becomes more excitable and erratically fires pain impulses. Tumors and bony abnormalities of the skull may also press on and irritate the trigeminal nerve. In addition, trauma, infections, and multiple sclerosis can also damage the trigeminal nerve.","There is no single medical test to diagnose tic douloureux. The diagnosis is made based on the description of the pain, physical examination, and exclusion of other causes of facial pain. The pain is unique. A history of bursts of shooting pain in one side of the face along with a trigger zone will give the doctor good clues to the cause of your pain. The physical examination is normal in tic douloureux. If numbness, decreased hearing, dizziness, visual changes, or dysfunction of the muscles of the face is found, then other disorders may be considered. Additionally, other causes of facial pain such as a sinus infection, dental infection, or a jaw disorder, such as TMJ, can often be found by physical examination. Special X-ray images, such as a CT scan or MRI of the head, can look for other causes of facial pain. They can also help delineate blood vessels or tumors that might be pressing on the nerve and irritating it.","There are no effective home treatment remedies for tic douloureux. Treatment should be guided by a physician. The role of the doctor is to ensure the diagnosis, begin appropriate therapy, and coordinate any potential need for consultants. In most cases, effective treatment will require only medications. Uncommonly, surgery will be recommended. The primary treatment of tic douloureux is medication to control the pain. Surgery may be necessary when drug therapy is not effective or side effects from the medications are not tolerable. A number of medications can be effective in helping control the pain of tic douloureux. The most commonly prescribed medications are anticonvulsants (seizure medications). Anticonvulsants help to stop the irritated trigeminal nerve from firing pain impulses.Medication is at least partly effective for most people who suffer with tic douloureux. For the rest, drug therapy either fails to provide adequate pain control or adverse side effects are intolerable. Unfortunately, many people who initially respond to anticonvulsants eventually develop resistance to the medications. Surgery When pain cannot be controlled with medication, surgical options should be discussed with a neurosurgeon. Surgery could range from simple injections of anesthetic into the trigeminal nerve to complex procedures that must be performed in the operating room. In general, the more complex procedures provide longer-lasting pain relief but with greater potential for more serious complications.  "

Your symptoms often come and go. Bouts of symptoms are called flares. Going long periods without symptoms is called remission. Most people with Behcet’s syndrome have sores in the mouth and on the genitals. But the swelling of blood vessels it causes can bring on symptoms throughout your body: Mouth: Eyes:Genitals: Skin: Joints: Brain and spinal cord: Digestive system: Sometimes, Behcet’s affects other organs, like the kidneys and lungs.","Doctors aren’t sure what causes Behcet’s syndrome. They believe it starts when the immune system mistakenly attacks the blood vessels. You’re more likely to get it if you have a problem with your immune system.

It has symptoms similar to many other conditions, including Crohn’s disease, lupus, and arthritis. Your doctor may want to give you a blood test to rule out other conditions. It can take months to find out for sure that you have Behcet’s. Doctors will look at your medical history, do a physical exam, and look for groups of symptoms. You may be diagnosed with Behcet’s if you have mouth sores at least three times in a year, and you have at least two of these symptoms:Doctors who treat Behcet’s Which doctors you see will depend on your symptoms: Because you may have many symptoms, you may need to visit several of these doctors.","Your treatments will be based on your symptoms. Corticosteroids can calm the immune system and bring down swelling in your body. Other medicines that work to help your immune system response can also be prescribed, such as adalimumab (Humira), azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), and infliximab (Remicade). Creams or ointments can ease skin and genital sores. Your doctor may recommend nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, and colchicine for joint pain and swelling.

Tubal Pregnancy,https://www.webmd.com/baby/pregnancy-ectopic-pregnancy,"Usually, a fertilized egg attaches itself to the lining in your uterus. But with an ectopic pregnancy (also called extrauterine pregnancy), the fertilized egg grows outside your uterus. This can include other areas like a fallopian tube, the ovaries, in your belly, or the lower part of your cervix, which is above the vagina. In more than 90% of cases, the egg attaches itself in a fallopian tube. This is called a tubal pregnancy. Rates are hard to determine, but one study suggests that about 1 in 50 pregnancies in the U.S. are ectopic. As the fertilized egg grows, it can burst (rupture) and can cause life-threatening bleeding. If this happens, you will need medical care right away. If you don’t treat it, it can be deadly. In fact, ectopic pregnancies are the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the first trimester. Can a baby survive an ectopic pregnancy? No. It’s important to note that the fertilized egg in an ectopic pregnancy is not “viable.” That means it’s impossible for the egg to survive and grow into a baby that can survive in or outside your body. It will always result in a pregnancy loss. That’s because the egg can’t get the blood supply and support it needs to grow outside of the uterus.  ","At first you may not have any symptoms of an early ectopic pregnancy. They may seem very similar to those of a normal pregnancy. You might miss your period and have discomfort in your belly and tenderness in your breasts. Only about half of women with an ectopic pregnancy will have all three of the main signs: a missed period, vaginal bleeding, and belly pain. Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy include: An ectopic pregnancy can cause your fallopian tube to burst, or rupture. Emergency symptoms include major pain, with or without severe bleeding. Call your doctor right away if you have heavy vaginal bleeding with lightheadedness, fainting, or shoulder pain, or if you have severe belly pain, especially on one side. You might need to call 911 or head to the nearest hospital to have it treated right away.",You may never know why you have an ectopic pregnancy. One cause could be a damaged fallopian tube. It could keep the fertilized egg from getting into your uterus. You’re more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy if you: It could also happen if you become pregnant while you have an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control.,"Your doctor will probably do tests that include a pregnancy test and a pelvic exam. They might give you an ultrasound to look at your uterus and fallopian tubes. An ultrasound for ectopic pregnancy is a noninvasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the uterus. The test is performed by a sonographer and may be done transvaginally or transabdominally. During the ultrasound, the doctor will look for the presence of a gestational sac, the location of the gestational sac, and whether there is a fetal heartbeat. The test is painless and usually takes around 15 to 20 minutes. An abdominal ultrasound test, which is performed by moving a wand over the abdomen, may be used to confirm pregnancy or check for internal bleeding.","Because a fertilized egg can’t survive outside a uterus, your doctor will need to take it out, so you don’t have serious health problems. They’ll use one of two methods: medication or surgery.Medication. If your fallopian tube hasn’t ruptured and your pregnancy isn’t far along, your doctor can give you a shot of methotrexate (Trexall). You only need one dose of the injection. It stops the fertilized egg from growing. Your body will absorb the egg in about 4-6 weeks. With this treatment, there’s no need to remove the fallopian tube. Before you can take methotrexate, your doctor will need to run a few blood tests to measure your levels of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin). It’s the hormone your body makes when it detects a pregnancy. You won’t be able to take methotrexate if you’re breastfeeding or have certain health problems. Once you get the shot, the doctor will check your hCG levels during follow-up appointments. If your levels don’t drop after the first dose, you might need a second dose of the same medication. You’ll need to follow up until your blood no longer has hCG."
Tuberculosis (TB),https://www.webmd.com/lung/understanding-tuberculosis-basics,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious infection that usually attacks your lungs. It can also spread to other parts of your body, like your brain and spine. A type of bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes it. Can tuberculosis be cured? In the 20th century, TB was a leading cause of death in the United States. Today, most cases are cured with antibiotics. But it takes a long time. You have to take medications for at least 6 to 9 months.","Latent TB doesn’t have symptoms. A skin or blood test can tell if you have it. Signs of active TB disease include: If you have any of these symptoms, see your doctor to get tested. Get medical help right away if you have chest pain.",You could be more likely to get TB if:A healthy immune system fights the TB bacteria. But you might not be able to fend off active TB disease if you have: Babies and young children also have higher chances of getting it because their immune systems aren’t fully formed.,"There are two common tests for tuberculosis: Those tests don’t tell you if your infection is latent or active. If you get a positive skin or blood test, your doctor will learn which type you have with:","Your treatment will depend on your infection. Whatever kind of infection you have, it’s important to finish taking all of your medications, even when you feel better. If you quit too soon, the bacteria can become resistant to the drugs."
Tuberculous Meningitis,https://www.webmd.com/children/understanding-meningitis-basics,Meningitis is a rare infection that affects the delicate membranes -- called meninges -- that cover the brain and spinal cord. You or your children can catch it.    ,"Meningitis symptoms can develop within hours or days and may include:Symptoms of meningitis in infants In infants, meningitis symptoms may include:  ","Meningitis almost always results from a bacterial or viral infection that begins somewhere else in your body, like your ears, sinuses, or throat. Less common causes of meningitis include:  ","Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam, including checking your neck for stiffness and looking for a skin rash that might suggest a bacterial infection. They will also need to do tests that can include:  ","Your treatment will depend on the type of meningitis you have. Bacterial meningitis needs treatment with antibiotics right away. The doctor might give you a general, or broad-spectrum, antibiotic even before they’ve found the exact bacteria that caused your illness. Once they do, they’ll change to a drug that targets the specific bacteria they find with the spinal tap. You might also get corticosteroids to ease inflammation.Viral meningitis usually goes away on its own without treatment. Your doctor might tell you to stay in bed, drink plenty of fluids, and take over-the-counter pain medicines if you have a fever or aches. If a virus like herpes or influenza caused your illness, you might take antiviral medication. Antifungal medications can treat fungal meningitis. There is a possibility of being hospitalized if you are dehydrated or have severe symptoms.  "
Tuberose Sclerosis,https://www.webmd.com/children/tuberous-sclerosis,"If you have tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), your cells don’t stop dividing when they should. This means you get tumors in lots of places in your body. They aren’t cancer, but they can cause problems where they’re growing. There are treatments available that can shrink the tumors and make you more comfortable. Every case is different. You might get TSC in certain parts of your body, and TSC might affect someone else differently. The tumors can look like thick or light patches on your skin, and if they're in your lungs, they can cause breathing problems. Treatments can help you manage your symptoms and live an independent life. Between 1 million and 2 million people around the world have this condition.","Symptoms usually show up early, shortly after birth. But they can also appear later in life. Your symptoms depend on how many tumors you have, how big they are, and where they are. When you have TSC, all of that can change throughout your life. Tumors in a kidney can stop it from working like it should. They can also cause bleeding inside your body or high blood pressure. Tumors in your heart usually happen when you're young, and they shrink over time. But they can block blood flow or cause problems with your heart rhythm. Lung tumors can make you short of breath, even after mild exercise. They can also cause a cough or make your lung collapse. Tumors in your brain could cause: Tumors in your eyes can make you see double or give you blurry vision.In other places in your body, you may have patches of different color skin and dark or light growths that might look like warts. In your mouth, tuberous sclerosis can weaken the enamel on your teeth or make your gums overgrow.","You get TSC because of a problem in your genes. For most people, it’s caused by changes that happened when your cells were first coming together or when you were just an embryo. About a third of people inherit TSC from a parent. If one of your parents has it, you have a 50% chance of getting it.","With so many different symptoms, diagnosing this condition can be tricky. Your doctor will talk with you before doing any testing, asking questions such as: Your doctor may check your eyes and skin, as well as ask you to get imaging tests. These can include: ","Your treatment will depend on your particular case. Doctors target the places where the tumors are growing. If TSC is affecting your kidneys, doctors may be able to block or reduce blood flow to kidney tumors, or give you drugs to help shrink them. You may need surgery to remove the tumors. At some point, you may also need dialysis or a kidney transplant.If you have tumors in your brain, sometimes drugs can shrink them, or surgeons can remove them."

Tularemia,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-tularemia,"People can become sick with tularemia, but it’s not a disease that naturally occurs in humans. It often affects rabbits and other animals including rodents, sheep, and birds. House pets like dogs and cats can get tularemia too. These are some of the ways people can get it: It’s also possible to become infected if you’re exposed to the bacteria in a laboratory setting, or potentially, in an act of bioterrorism. Tularemia can happen anywhere in the world, but it’s most common in rural areas where animals are more likely to be infected with the bacteria. It can survive in soil, water, and dead animals for weeks. That’s why it can cause infections in so many different ways. The way you become infected with the disease influences the type of symptoms you’ll have and how severe they may be. But just because you’re exposed to the bacteria doesn’t mean you’ll become sick with the disease.","If you do become sick after being exposed to Francisella tularensis, you’re likely to start having symptoms within 3 to 5 days, but it can take up to 2 weeks. There are different types of tularemia that each have their own specific symptoms. Ulceroglandular tularemia is the most common variety of the disease. Symptoms can include: Oculoglandular tularemia affects the eyes. Symptoms can include:Oropharyngeal tularemia affects the mouth, throat, and digestive system. It’s the form of the disease that’s most often caused by eating undercooked meat from a wild animal or drinking water that’s contaminated. Symptoms can include:",Tularemia is rare. There were only 229 reported cases in the United States in 2018. People get it most from tick bites or contact with a contaminated animal. The following can also increase your risk for developing tularemia:,"It can be hard to diagnose tularemia because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases. Your doctor will test you to confirm the bacteria is present. They may also order a chest X-ray to check for signs of pneumonia. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, either injected or by mouth. If you have complications like pneumonia or meningitis, you’ll also need treatment for these conditions. Usually people who have had tularemia become immune to it, but some people get it more than once.","It can be hard to diagnose tularemia because the symptoms can be similar to other diseases.

Turner Syndrome,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-turner-syndrome,"Turner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that’s found only in girls. It can cause problems ranging from short height to heart defects. Sometimes, the symptoms are so mild that it doesn’t get diagnosed until a female is a teen or young adult. The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.","Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.","Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy. A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism. When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.X chromosome abnormalities. Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material. In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.","If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing.","Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). This condition affects about 10% of identical twins, who share a placenta. TTTS develops when a connection between the babies' blood vessels allows one baby to get too little blood and the other too much. A doctor can treat TTTS with laser surgery to seal off the vessel connection or with amniocentesis to drain excess amniotic fluid.Preeclampsia. You are more than twice as likely to develop preeclampsia than women carrying one baby. Preeclampsia is marked by: If you have this, you may need early delivery to prevent serious complications. If not treated, preeclampsia can deprive your baby of oxygen and nutrients and can damage your organs. Gestational diabetes. If you develop diabetes (high blood sugar) during pregnancy, your babies may grow too big. Delivering big babies increases your risk of complications during delivery, and may require you to deliver by cesarean. Your babies may also have breathing problems and low blood sugar when they are born. But you can take steps, such as with diet, to lower your risk. Iron deficiency anemia. A lack of healthy red blood cells from too little iron can lead to premature birth. Be sure to add iron to your diet as recommended by your doctor. Yes, these are serious risks, but try not to worry too much. With good prenatal care, you and your doctor can lower your risk and spot any problems earlier, rather than later. Then you can work with your doctor to manage and minimize the impact of any complications.No pregnancy is entirely free of risks. But carrying twins can put you and your babies at increased risk for certain pregnancy-related complications, including premature birth and diabetes. Don't let this alarm you. With good prenatal care, you can greatly increase your chances of enjoying a healthy pregnancy and healthy babies.",,
Type 1 Diabetes,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes,"Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which your immune system destroys insulin-making cells in your pancreas. These are called beta cells. The condition is usually diagnosed in children and young people, so it used to be called juvenile diabetes. A condition called secondary diabetes is like type 1, but your beta cells are wiped out by something else, like a disease or an injury to your pancreas, rather than by your immune system. Both of these are different from type 2 diabetes, in which your body doesn’t respond to insulin the way it should.","Signs are often subtle, but they can become severe. They include: Signs of an emergency with type 1 diabetes include:",Only about 5% of people with diabetes have type 1. It affects males and females equally. You’re at higher risk of getting it if you:,"If your doctor thinks you have type 1 diabetes, they’ll check your blood sugar levels. They may test your urine for glucose or chemicals your body makes when you don’t have enough insulin.","People who have type 1 diabetes can live long, healthy lives. You’ll need to keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels. Your doctor will give you a range that the numbers should stay within. Adjust your insulin, food, and activities as necessary. Everyone with type 1 diabetes needs to use insulin shots to control their blood sugar. When your doctor talks about insulin, they’ll mention three main things: Several types of insulin are available.Your doctor may start you out with two injections a day of two types of insulin. Later, you might need more shots. Most insulin comes in a small glass bottle called a vial. You draw it out with a syringe that has a needle on the end and give yourself the shot. Some kinds come in a prefilled pen. Another kind is inhaled. You can also get it from a pump, a device you wear that sends it into your body through a small tube. Your doctor will help you pick the type and the delivery method that’s best for you."
Type 2 Diabetes,https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-2-diabetes,"Type 2 diabetes is a lifelong disease that keeps your body from using insulin the way it should. People with type 2 diabetes are said to have insulin resistance. People who are middle-aged or older are most likely to get this kind of diabetes. It used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But type 2 diabetes also affects kids and teens, mainly because of childhood obesity. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes. There are about 29 million people in the U.S. with type 2. Another 84 million have prediabetes, meaning their blood sugar (or blood glucose) is high but not high enough to be diabetes yet.","The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be so mild that you don't notice them. About 8 million people who have it don't know it. Symptoms include: If you have dark rashes around your neck or armpits, see your doctor. These are called acanthosis nigricans, and they can be signs that your body is becoming resistant to insulin.","Certain things make it more likely that you’ll get type 2 diabetes. The more of these that apply to you, the higher your chances of getting it are. Some things are related to who you are: Risk factors related to your health and medical history include: Other things that raise your risk of diabetes have to do with your daily habits and lifestyle. These are the ones you can do something about:","Your doctor can test your blood for signs of type 2 diabetes. Usually, they’ll test you on 2 days to confirm the diagnosis. But if your blood glucose is very high or you have many symptoms, one test may be all you need.","Managing type 2 diabetes includes a mix of lifestyle changes and medication.

They can tell if they're overweight based on their age, weight, and height. They’ll test their blood sugar to see if they have diabetes or prediabetes. If they do have diabetes, it may take a few extra steps to find out if it's type 1 or type 2. Until they know for sure, they may give them insulin. Once they confirm it's type 2 diabetes, they’ll ask you to help them make lifestyle changes. They may suggest they take a medication called metformin. It and insulin are the only two blood sugar-lowering medicines approved for kids younger than age 18, but others are being studied. Your child should get a hemoglobin A1c test every 3 months. This test measures their average blood sugar levels over that period. They’ll need to check their blood sugar:The doctor will teach you both how to test blood sugar and tell you how often. Most experts suggest three or more times a day if they're on insulin. If they're not, they can check less often, but should do it after meals. They can use a traditional finger stick test or a continuous glucose monitor. "
Type II Histiocytosis,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/cancer-langerhans-cell-histiocytosis,"LCH can show up on many places on your body, but most often on your skin and bones. It can affect any organ, including your lungs, liver, brain, spleen, or lymph nodes. In about 8 out of 10 people, LCH leads to tumors called granulomas in the skull and in other bones. That can cause pain and swelling, and sometimes it can fracture your arms or legs.  LCH symptoms can range from mild to more serious. Some people are born with it, and the disease eventually goes away on its own. But others have a severe and long-lasting type that affects multiple parts of the body.Along with your bones, it can affect your:  Skin. Red, scaly bumps in skin folds are common. Infants with LCH can get red, scaly scalps, which is often mistaken for cradle cap, a common skin condition. Liver. Usually, only severe cases of LCH affect the liver. Your skin might appear jaundiced, or yellow, and your blood can take longer to clot. Lymph nodes. These glands, which are behind the ears, in the neck, and in other places, can swell up.

About half of the people with the disorder have a faulty gene that makes the Langerhans immune cells grow out of control. That genetic mutation happens after birth, which means you usually won’t get LCH from your parents. Researchers suspect that other things may also play a role: ","Your doctor will know if you have LCH after a tissue biopsy. That’s when a specialist called a pathologist views the sample under a microscope for specific proteins and other markers of the disease. In addition to the physical exam, your doctors may order other tests based on your symptoms: ","As with some types of cancer, doctors sometimes treat LCH with chemotherapy. Many people with the disorder get care from cancer specialists like oncologists and haematologists. But unlike most cancers, limited forms of LCH sometimes spontaneously go away on their own. Beside chemotherapy, options for treatment include: A great majority of people with LCH recover with treatment. If the disease is in your spleen, liver, or bone marrow, it’s called a high-risk LCH. About 80% of people with that type survive.You may know that white blood cells are your body’s infection fighters. But if your body makes too much of a type of immune cell called histiocytes, they can cause tumors, lesions, and other tissue damage. One of these rare disorders -- which resembles some types of cancer -- is called Langerhans cell histiocytosis, or LCH.

You’ll also hear doctors call them by their initials: Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein. One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons.","UCDs fall into two groups: Complete UCD: This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days:Partial UCD: Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years. A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss. Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include:",,"Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies. If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy. They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis.","UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment. A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time: Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel.

Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cells,https://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/cord-blood-banking-deciding-public-private-donations,"Cord blood banking is a process of collecting potentially life-saving stem cells from the umbilical cord and placenta and storing them for future use. Stem cells are immature cells that can assume the form of other cells.  There are so many things to think about when you have a child. One of them is the blood from your baby’s umbilical cord (which connects the baby to the mother while in the womb). It used to be thrown away at birth, but now, many parents store the blood for the future health of their child. Should you do it?",,,,
Umbilical Cord Care,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/baby-umbilical-cord,"The umbilical cord is the tube-like structure that carries food and oxygen from a mother to their baby while pregnant. It also carries waste products away from the baby so the mother’s body can get rid of them. After you give birth, doctors clamp and cut the cord. The cord has no nerves, so neither you nor your baby will feel anything. A small stump will be left on your child’s belly. It can be anywhere from a half-inch to an inch long. At first, the stump might look shiny and yellow. But as it dries out, it may turn brown or gray or even purplish or blue. It’ll shrivel and turn black before it falls off on its own. Usually, it comes off between 10 and 14 days after your baby is born, but can take as long as 21 days.",,,,
Umbilical Hernia in Children,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/what-are-umbilical-hernias,"Umbilical hernias are swollen bumps that appear when part of your intestines stick out through your abdominal muscles near your navel. If your baby has a bulge around the bellybutton, they may have an umbilical hernia. Before the umbilical cord falls off, you may notice that the area seems to stick out a little more when the baby cries. Or maybe, once the cord is gone, you see that their navel sticks out (an “outie,” as it’s commonly called). In some cases, even if you can’t see a bulge, you might be able to feel one.","You’ll be able to see the hernia most clearly when your child cries, coughs, or strains while trying to poop. That’s because all of these things put pressure on the abdomen. When your child rests, you might not be able to see the hernia. Usually, they don’t hurt. Your child’s doctor can tell if there’s a hernia during a physical exam. You’ll want to keep a close eye on your child’s hernia for signs that the intestine has been trapped in the hole and can’t go back in. Doctors call this an incarcerated hernia. Symptoms include: If you notice any of these symptoms, take your baby to the emergency room.","While you’re pregnant, the umbilical cord is connected to your baby’s abdominal muscles through a small hole. This usually closes up after the baby’s born. When it doesn’t, the gap that’s left is called an umbilical hernia. If intestines and fluid poke through it, they cause the belly to bulge or swell. Forget what you may have heard: The way the doctor cuts or clamps the cord when your child is born doesn’t affect whether an umbilical hernia will form or not.It’s less common, but adults can also get umbilical hernias. Adult umbilical hernias often happen over time when abdominal pressure goes up. You might have this because of:  ","In order to see if you’re dealing with an umbilical hernia, your doctor will feel and look at the area. They’ll also ask you for your symptom history. Your doctor may try to see if they can push the bulge of the hernia back into your abdomen. Sometimes a doctor may suggest you get a CT scan to check for complications.","Most umbilical hernias don’t need any treatment. Usually, the hole heals on its own by the time your child is 4 or 5 years old. Even if it doesn’t, it’ll likely get smaller. That’ll make surgery a bit easier. You might think it looks like your child needs to have an operation, but their doctor might suggest you wait to see if the problem goes away on its own. If the hole is large, they may recommend surgery before your child turns 4 or 5. Your doctor may also suggest surgery if the hernia is:The procedure is done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center. It takes about 45 minutes, and your child will be given anesthesia and won’t be awake. The surgeon will make a small cut just below the bellybutton. If any part of the intestine pokes through, it will be put back where it belongs. The doctor will use stitches to close the hernia. They’ll also sew the skin under the navel to give it an “innie” look. Then, the cut will be sealed with surgical glue that’ll hold the edges of the wound together. It’ll come off by itself once the site heals. After the procedure, your child will stay at the hospital while they recover from the anesthesia. Most kids can go home a few hours later."
"Uncircumcised Penis, Care and Cleaning",https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/your-newborn-boys-genitals-care-of-penis,"If your son was circumcised, that means the loose skin covering the head of their penis was removed and the tip exposed. After the procedure, their care team covered their penis with petroleum jelly and wrapped it in gauze. Keep a covering on the area for the 48 hours following the procedure. For the first couple of days after the surgery, your doctor may recommend keeping the area covered with a glob of petroleum jelly on a square gauze pad. Change the pad after poopy diapers to prevent an infection. After a couple of days, once the area starts to heal, you can stop using the gauze and just put some petroleum jelly on the tip. This will keep their healing penis from sticking to their diaper.Change their diaper often, and use a mild soap and water to clean off any poop that gets on their penis. It’s normal for the tip of the penis to look red and appear to have a crusty white or yellow coating. That helps the area heal -- don’t wipe it off. Once the penis is healed, usually after 7-10 days, you can wash it with soap and water. Problems are rare, but let your doctor know if: Usually once the circumcision is healed, you don’t need to do anything special.

Unconjugated Benign Bilirubinemia,https://www.webmd.com/children/what-is-gilbert-syndrome,"  Gilbert’s syndrome (also called constitutional hepatic dysfunction or familial nonhemolytic jaundice) is a common disorder that's passed through families. When you have it, too much of a waste product called bilirubin builds up in your blood. It can make your skin and eyes look yellow from time to time. Gilbert’s syndrome looks scarier than it is. It's a harmless condition that doesn't need to be treated.","Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't have symptoms. They have enough of the liver enzyme to control their bilirubin levels.When bilirubin does build up in the blood, it causes the skin and whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice. See your doctor if you notice a yellow color to your skin and eyes because another condition could be causing it. Jaundice can cause other symptoms such as: Jaundice is a common problem in babies. But it’s worse in babies born with Gilbert’s syndrome. Certain things can make your bilirubin levels rise, but you might only notice jaundice when you:","It happens when a gene called UGT1A1 changes, or mutates. This gene carries instructions for making a liver enzyme that helps break down and get rid of the bilirubin in your body. Parents pass UGT1A1 gene mutations to their children. You need two copies of the mutated gene -- one from each parent -- to get it. Even if you do have both genes, you might not have Gilbert’s syndrome. Gilbert’s syndrome is more common in men than in women.","Although people are born with Gilbert’s syndrome, sometimes they don’t get diagnosed until their 20s or 30s. You may have a blood test for another reason and your doctor may notice you have high bilirubin levels, which may be a clue that you have the syndrome.They may do more tests to diagnose you, including: ","Most people with Gilbert’s syndrome don't need treatment. Jaundice doesn't cause any long-term problems. To prevent it, try to avoid things that make your bilirubin levels rise. For instance: The same liver enzyme that breaks down bilirubin also breaks down certain medicines, including: If you have Gilbert’s syndrome and you take any of these drugs, you're at higher risk for side effects like diarrhea. Ask your doctor before you take any new medicine. And don't take more than the recommended dose."
Underactive Thyroid,https://www.webmd.com/women/hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-symptoms-causes-treatments,"Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid disease, is a common disorder. With hypothyroidism, your thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is located in the front lower part of your neck. Hormones released by the gland travel through your bloodstream and affect nearly every part of your body, from your heart and brain, to your muscles and skin.  The thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food, a process called metabolism. Among other things, your metabolism affects your body’s temperature, your heartbeat, and how well you burn calories. If you don't have enough thyroid hormone, your body processes slow down. That means your body makes less energy, and your metabolism becomes sluggish.","Symptoms of hypothyroidism may be vague and can often mimic other conditions. They may include:Babies with hypothyroidism may have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they can include: Make an appointment with your health care provider if you or your baby has any of these symptoms. It’s important to note that these symptoms can be due to other medical conditions. Children and teens may also have hypothyroidism with the signs and symptoms seen in adults. Kids and teens may also have:","Women, particularly older women, are more likely to develop hypothyroidism than men. You are also more likely to develop hypothyroidism if you have a close family member with an autoimmune disease. Other risk factors include:","If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism, your doctor will order blood tests to check hormone levels. These may include:Lower-than-normal T4 levels usually mean you have hypothyroidism. However, some people may have increased TSH levels while having normal T4 levels. This is called subclinical (mild) hypothyroidism. It is believed to be an early stage of hypothyroidism. If your test results or physical exam of the thyroid are abnormal, your doctor may order a thyroid ultrasound, or thyroid scan, to check for nodules or inflammation.","If you have hypothyroidism, your doctor will prescribe a synthetic (human-made) thyroid hormone T4. You take this pill every day. Certain other medications can interfere with how your body absorbs synthetic thyroid hormone. Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, herbs, and supplements you take, including over-the-counter products. You will need regular blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. Your doctor may need to adjust your medication dose from time to time. It may take a little time to figure out the correct dosage of thyroid hormone that you need. Your doctor will give you a blood test to check your TSH levels 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking synthetic hormones, and then once every 6 months.If your dosage is too high and you get too much hormone, you could have these side effects: People with severe hypothyroidism or heart disease may start out with a low dose of synthetic hormone, and then gradually increase the amount so their heart can adjust to it. Once you have the correct dosage, you shouldn’t have any side effects from your hormones. But don’t stop or skip your medication, because your hypothyroidism symptoms could come back. If you gain or lose even as much as 10 pounds of body weight, you may need to get your TSH levels checked again to see if your hormone dosage should be adjusted."
Understanding Lab Test Results,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/lab-test-results,"Before you leave your doctor’s office, ask when you’ll know the results. And ask the office staff to let you know when they’re in. (Some offices might not call if you don’t request it, especially if the results are in the normal range. Some offices also have options to allow access to your lab results on patient portals) What do my results mean? Here are a few things to look for: Positive vs. Negative. Some lab tests answer yes-or-no questions like whether you’re pregnant or have certain kinds of infections. These results are usually written as “positive” or “negative.” In this case, positive doesn’t necessarily mean “good” and negative doesn’t necessarily mean “bad.” Instead:",,,"Always keep a copy of your results. This can be useful in case you switch doctors, need to show them to a specialist, or just want to look at them again later.Remind your doctor if you take medications or have a health condition that can affect your results. That should be in your record, but it’s still a good idea to mention it. Be honest if you didn’t follow the instructions. With some lab tests, you’re supposed to fast (not eat), or not do certain activities, eat certain foods, or take certain drugs. If you forget and mess up, don’t worry -- just tell your doctor before you do the test. It’s not a big deal to reschedule, and it’s a waste of time to get the test if the results won’t be right. Make sure your doctor always uses the same lab to do your tests if possible. It can be hard to compare results from different labs because they may approach the test differently. For example, one lab might have different ranges for “normal” and “abnormal” than another. Ask your doctor questions about your results like:If you’re waiting for lab test results to come back or you’re trying to figure out what they mean, the process and all those medical terms and numbers can be confusing. There are thousands of lab tests, and their results can mean different things. But a few general guidelines can help shed some light. How do doctors use lab tests? Nobody likes to get poked with a needle or pee in a cup. But lab tests are important tools, and doctors use them in a few different ways: How long does it take to get results?

This could be:Angioplasty/stenting. The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again. The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You’ll probably stay overnight at the hospital. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery. Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.

They can include: Problems with your prostate. It’s common for prostate issues to cause urinary incontinence. Your prostate may be larger due to a non-cancerous condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Your prostate may also be bigger than usual because of cancer. An enlarged prostate can block your urethra. When your urethra is blocked, your bladder has to work harder to squeeze pee out. This makes its walls thicker and weaker. That makes it hard for your bladder to empty all the urine in it.

Your doctor can help you come up with a plan that’s right for you. Behavioral therapies, vaginal inserts, electrical stimulation and surgery are the four treatment options for women with stress incontinence. The objective is to rehabilitate the pelvic floor by building the strength and function of the muscles that support the bladder, urethra and other organs contained within the pelvic region.  For stress incontinence, treatments include: Pads and Vaginal Inserts. Pelvic floor exercises. If you've had a baby, chances are you've been told to do Kegel exercises. These help to strengthen the pelvic floor after childbirth. They also help prevent stress incontinence. Best of all, you can do Kegels anytime, anywhere. Here's how: Note: You can learn how to do Kegels by stopping your urine, but don’t do this routinely. Stopping the flow of urine can lead to an infection. Biofeedback. A probe is inserted to monitor when your bladder muscles squeeze. When you’re able to recognize it as it's happening, you can start to gain control of it. It's often used in combination with Kegel exercises. Electrical Stimulation: electrical stimulation is FDA approved for the treatment of SUI. It uses low-grade electrical current to stimulate weak or inactive pelvic muscles to contract.

After menopause, women who take hormone replacement therapy may still have periods. But any bleeding should be checked out.","There are a few possible causes behind abnormal uterine bleeding: Hormone changes. Problems with your hormones are the most common reason for abnormal uterine bleeding. When one of your ovaries releases an egg (called ovulation), certain hormones tell your body to build up and then shed the lining of your uterus (called the endometrium). With teenagers and women getting close to menopause, the endometrium can build up too much. That can lead to an irregular or heavy period or spotting between periods.These things can throw off your hormones, too: Problems with your uterus. Another possible reason for abnormal bleeding is a physical problem with your uterus. Millions of women have fibroids -- noncancerous tumors that grow in the muscles of the wall of the uterus. A polyp is another kind of growth that can form in the lining of your uterus. A condition called adenomyosis is where the cells similar to the ones that grow in the lining of the uterus start to grow in the muscle part of the uterus.

You could just have an infection. But it’s important to get it checked out.","Some cases of vaginal cancer don’t have a clear cause. But most are linked to infection with the human papillomavirus, or HPV. This is the most common sexually transmitted disease (STD). An HPV infection most often goes away on its own, but if it lingers, it can lead to cervical and vaginal cancer.

This is called a biopsy.","You and your doctor will decide on treatment based on many things, including how close the cancer is to other organs, its stage, whether you’ve had radiation treatment in your pelvic area, and whether you’ve had a hysterectomy to remove your uterus. Your doctor will probably recommend one or more of these treatments: Surgery. This is the most common treatment. Your doctor may use a laser to cut out tissue or growths. In some cases, they might remove all or part of your vagina. You may need a hysterectomy to remove your cervix or other organs.Many women can have a normal sex life after surgery. But sex can raise your chances of infection, and it can cause bleeding or strain the surgical site. Your doctor will tell you what’s safe to do and when it's safe. Radiation therapy. This treatment uses high-powered X-rays or other forms of radiation to kill cancer. Your doctor might use a machine that sends X-rays into your body, or they could insert a radioactive substance inside your body, on or near the cancer. Radiation treatments in your pelvic area can damage your ovaries. That can cause them to stop making estrogen, leading to menopause symptoms like hot flashes and vaginal dryness. If you’ve been through menopause, you probably won’t have these problems. This type of therapy also can irritate healthy tissue. Your vagina might get swollen and tender. Sex may be painful. Chemotherapy (“chemo”). This uses medication to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. You might take the medication by mouth or get it injected into a vein (intravenous or IV). In some cases, your doctor might give you a chemo in lotion or cream form. You may lose your sex drive or have side effects like nausea, hair loss, and changes in body weight.

Though yeast infections can happen to anyone at any time, there are certain things that make getting them more likely. Most infections can be cleared up quickly and easily. The vagina normally contains a healthy balance of bacteria and yeast. The hormone estrogen helps bacteria called lactobacilli to grow. These bacteria kill harmful organisms in the vagina and keep you healthy.

They gently stretch the baby’s foot some more, puts it in a new position, and puts on a new cast. They'll continue this pattern for weeks or months. Your doctor may take X-rays to be sure the baby’s bones are slowly moving into their correct positions. If the series of casts helps to correct your baby’s clubfoot, they’ll need to wear a special brace or shoe to keep it at the right angle until after they've learned to walk.

It’s not common, but because CMTC may affect growth of the limb where it appears, your child could have one leg or arm that’s longer than the other. Some children with CMTC in their legs also get superficial venous insufficiency -- that’s where the veins in the legs have trouble pushing blood back up to the heart. Beyond those two problems, it’s less clear. In the past, it looked like children with CMTC were also sometimes born with issues ranging from pressure buildup in the eye (glaucoma) to muscle loss. But more recent studies seem to show that these children don’t have CMTC. Instead, they have other conditions such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and Cowden's disease.","Your doctor will talk to you about your child’s health history and do a physical exam. That’s typically enough to know if it’s CMTC. If your doctor thinks there’s a different problem, your child may get some imaging, such as an X-ray, CT, or MRI. If CMTC shows on the face or scalp, your child may get an eye exam and a neurological exam, which checks to make sure their brain, nerves, and spinal cord work as normal.","Often, children with CMTC don’t need treatment and the skin pattern goes away on its own. Usually, the pattern fades the most by the time your child is one, and it will continue to fade as your child’s skin thickens. In many cases, it’s gone within the first few years of life. And once it fades, it doesn’t come back. Even without treatment, you’ll likely have regular visits with your doctor to keep an eye out for any issues. This is especially important since doctors are always learning about CMTC and similar diseases.Your child may need treatment in the following cases: Your doctor will recommend a plan to treat these or any other symptoms. For example, if your child has bleeding, you’ll get special bandages for it. If that happens a lot, they may get treated with a device called a pulse dye laser. It destroys the blood vessels that cause problems even after CMTC has faded. It’s very effective, doesn’t harm the skin, and usually doesn’t cause scars. Also, CMTC may create some anxiety for you and your child. The pattern may not fade completely, and that can be hard on an older child if it’s easily seen, especially on the face or neck.

It generally shows up at birth or shortly after. Most often, it doesn’t need treatment and is just an issue of looks. It gets better as your child gets older. The pattern is formed by blood vessels near the skin that are wider than normal, but doctors don’t know what causes it. Once in a while, another family member also has CMTC, but that’s not typical.

Studies have shown that vaccination within three days of exposure is 90% effective at preventing illness; vaccination within five days of exposure is 70% effective. If you do get sick, the symptoms will be milder and shorter in duration.",,"The most common side effect from the chickenpox vaccine is swelling, soreness, or redness at the site of the injection. A small number of people may also develop a mild rash or a low-grade fever after vaccination. Serious reactions to the chickenpox vaccine are extremely rare, but they may include: If you think you may be having a serious reaction to the chickenpox vaccine, call your health care provider right away. Make a note of the symptoms you're experiencing, and report them to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) at 1-800-822-7967. Women who receive the chickenpox vaccine during pregnancy should contact their health care provider right away. Chickenpox during pregnancy can cause birth defects, so there may be a risk that the chickenpox vaccine could cause the same birth defects. As with other vaccines, the risks associated with the chickenpox vaccine are much lower than the risks associated with the disease itself.Chickenpox is a common illness caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Symptoms of chickenpox include fever and itchy spots or blisters all over the body. Chickenpox is usually mild and runs its course in five to 10 days, but it can cause more serious problems when teens and adults get it. People with weakened immune systems are especially susceptible to developing serious complications from chickenpox. Some complications that can arise from chickenpox include: Vaccination is the best way to prevent chickenpox. A chickenpox vaccine has been available in the U.S. since 1995 and is easy to get from a doctor or a public health clinic.

Varicose Veins,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-varicose-veins-basics,"Varicose veins are usually bulging, bluish cords running just beneath the surface of your skin. They almost always affect legs and feet. Visible swollen and twisted veins -- sometimes surrounded by patches of flooded capillaries known as spider veins -- are considered superficial varicose veins. Although they can be painful and disfiguring, they are usually harmless. When inflamed, they become tender to the touch and can hinder circulation to the point of causing swollen ankles, itchy skin, and aching in the affected limb. Besides a surface network of veins, your legs have an interior, or deep, venous network. On rare occasions, an interior leg vein becomes varicose. Such deep varicose veins are usually not visible, but they can cause swelling or aching throughout the leg and may be sites where blood clots can form. Varicose veins are a relatively common condition, and for many people they are a family trait. Women are at least twice as likely as men to develop them. In the U.S. alone, they affect about 23% of adult Americans.",," To help circulate oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to all parts of the body, your arteries have thick layers of muscle or elastic tissue. To push blood back to your heart, your veins rely mainly on surrounding muscles and a network of one-way valves. As blood flows through a vein, the cup-like valves open to allow blood through, then close to prevent backflow. In varicose veins, the valves do not work properly, allowing blood to pool in the vein and making it difficult for the muscles to push the blood ""uphill."" Instead of flowing from one valve to the next, the blood continues to pool in the vein, increasing venous pressure and the likelihood of congestion while causing the vein to bulge and twist. Because superficial veins have less muscle support than deep veins, they are more likely to become varicose. Any condition that puts excessive pressure on the legs or abdomen can lead to varicose veins. The most common pressure inducers are pregnancy, obesity, and standing for long periods. Chronic constipation and -- in rare cases, tumors -- also can cause varicose veins. Being sedentary also may contribute to varicosity because muscles that are out of condition offer poor blood-pumping action. The likelihood of varicosity also increases as veins weaken with age. A previous leg injury may damage the valves in a vein, which can result in a varicosity. Genetics also plays a role, so if other family members have varicose veins, there is a greater chance you will, too. Contrary to popular belief, sitting with crossed legs will not cause varicose veins, although it can aggravate an existing condition.",,
Variola Virus,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/smallpox-causes-treatment,"Smallpox is a contagious disease caused by a virus that’s no longer found in nature.For centuries, smallpox killed millions of people around the world. But thanks to global immunization programs, the deadly infectious disease was wiped out in the late 1970s. Today, scientists keep only a small amount of the virus alive under tightly controlled conditions in the U.S. and Russia for medical research. Routine smallpox vaccinations stopped in the U.S. and in many other countries in 1972, and in all other World Health Organization member countries by 1986. Many adults living today likely got the vaccine as children.","Smallpox gets its name from its most common sign of the disease: small blisters that pop up on the face, arms, and body, and fill up with pus. Other symptoms include:","Some of its side effects can be dangerous, especially for people with weak immune systems. They can range from skin reactions to a serious nervous system condition called encephalitis, which can lead to convulsions, coma, and death. But these side effects are very rare. Based on historical data, for every 1 million people vaccinated for smallpox, one to two people died from a bad reaction. Some people would have a higher risk of a reaction to the vaccine, like:  ","Because smallpox hasn’t been diagnosed in decades, it’s likely that doctors wouldn’t recognize the disease in patients right away. It’s possible to diagnose the condition by testing a sample of tissue taken from a smallpox blister. A single diagnosis would be considered a worldwide health emergency.","There’s only one known drug that can treat smallpox. The drug tecovirimat (TPOXX) was approved in 2018 for the treatment of smallpox should someone show symptoms of the virus. The drug cidofovir has also worked well in early studies. Getting the vaccine within 3 to 4 days of contact with the virus may make the disease less severe or may help prevent it. Beyond that, medical care aims to ease symptoms like fever and body aches, and control any other illnesses that a person can get when their immune system is weak. Antibiotics can help if someone gets a bacterial infection while they have smallpox."

Vascular Dementia,https://www.webmd.com/stroke/guide/vascular-dementia,"Compared to Alzheimer's disease, which happens when the brain's nerve cells break down, vascular dementia happens when part of the brain doesn't get enough blood carrying the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Though they happen in different ways, it is possible to have both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Discouraging as this sounds, there is ample reason to control the risk factors that contribute to vascular dementia. Allowing the condition to run its course without intervention can make Alzheimer's disease worse.","Symptoms of vascular dementia depend on what part of the brain is affected and to what extent. Like Alzheimer's disease, the symptoms of vascular dementia are often mild for a long time. They may include: Symptoms that suddenly get worse often signal a stroke. Doctors look for symptoms that progress in noticeable stages to diagnose vascular dementia. Alzheimer's, by comparison, progresses at a slow, steady pace. Another clue is impaired coordination or balance. In vascular dementia, problems walking or balancing can happen early. With Alzheimer's, these symptoms usually occur late in the disease.","Some risk factors for vascular dementia can be managed; others, like age and gender, cannot. Among all factors, high blood pressure carries the greatest risk; vascular dementia almost never occurs without it. Likewise, a high risk of stroke goes hand in hand with risk for vascular dementia. One-quarter to one-third of strokes are thought to result in some degree of dementia. People who smoke, consume excessive amounts of alcohol, have diabetes, or heart disease also have a higher rate of the condition. Vascular dementia most commonly occurs in people between the ages of 60 and 75. Men seem to be more vulnerable than women, and the condition affects African-Americans more often than other races. People whose age, sex, or race puts them at increased risk of vascular dementia have that much more reason to manage risk factors within their control. ",,"Currently, no available treatments can repair the damage of vascular dementia once it's happened. Nonetheless, diagnosis provides important knowledge and the opportunity to prevent further damage.Prevention typically involves bringing high blood pressure under control through exercise, diet, and medication. The same goes for diabetes if it exists. Patients should stop smoking and curb the use of alcohol.  Though medical options are limited, behavioral interventions such as cues and reminders can improve the quality of life for everyone involved. Family members and friends can place notes in visible locations around the house with daily plans and instructions for how to use basic items.

Here are some common brain lesions. Abscesses: Brain abscesses are areas of infection, including pus and inflamed tissue. They are not common, but they are life threatening. Brain abscesses often occur after an infection, usually in a nearby area, such as an ear, sinus, or dental infection. They can also appear after injury or surgery to the skull. Read more about the causes of abscesses. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs): An AVM is a type of brain lesion that occurs during early development. Arteries and veins in the brain grow in a tangle and become connected by tube-like structures called fistulae. The arteries are not as strong as normal arteries. The veins are often enlarge because of the constant flow of blood directly from the arteries through the fistulae to the veins. These fragile vessels may rupture, leaking blood into the brain. In addition, the brain tissue may not receive enough blood to function properly. Damage to the brain may cause seizures as the first symptoms of an AVM.Cerebral infarction: Infarction refers to death of tissue. A cerebral infarction, or stroke, is a brain lesion in which a cluster of brain cells die when they don't get enough blood. Recognize the signs and symptoms of a stroke. Cerebral palsy: This type of brain lesion occurs when a baby is still in the mother's womb, or during delivery. Cerebral palsy does not progress over time. The brain lesions affect the child's ability to move, which can also make communication and related skills difficult. However, many children with cerebral palsy have normal intellectual functioning. Read more on the symptoms and types of cerebral palsy. Multiple sclerosis (MS): With this condition, the immune system attacks and damages the nerve linings (myelin) in the brain and spinal cord. These lesions make it difficult for messages to be sent and received properly between the brain and the rest of the body. Learn more about the symptoms of MS. Tumors: Tumors are clumps of cells that grow abnormally from normal tissue. Some tumors in the brain are noncancerous, or benign. Others are cancerous. They may start in the brain, or they may spread from elsewhere in the body (metastatic). They may grow quickly or they may remain stable. Get more information on signs and symptoms of a brain tumor.","Symptoms of a brain lesion vary depending on the type, location, and size of the lesion. Symptoms common to several types of brain lesions include the following:","Brain lesions can be caused by injury, infection, exposure to certain chemicals, problems with the immune system, and more. Typically, their cause is unknown.",,"Treatment depends on the type of brain lesion. The goals of treatment may be to provide a cure, relieve symptoms, or improve the quality or length of life. Common approaches for treating brain lesions include the following: "
Vasculitis,https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/vasculitis-treatment,"Vasculitis is a general term for several conditions that cause inflammation in your blood vessels. It’s also called angiitis or arteritis. It can make your blood vessels weak, stretched, bigger, or narrower. They might close entirely. Vasculitis can affect people at any age. Some forms affect blood vessels that go to or supply specific organs like your skin, eyes, or brain. Other kinds might involve many organ systems at the same time. Some of these general forms could be mild and not need treatment. Others may be severe.","Vasculitis can have general symptoms like fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and fatigue. It can also cause specific problems, depending on the body part that’s involved. If it’s your skin, you might have a rash. If your nerves aren’t getting enough blood, you could have numbness and weakness. Vasculitis in your brain may cause a stroke. You could have a heart attack if it affects your heart. Inflammation in the vessels supplying blood to your kidney can lead to kidney failure.If you notice anything unusual, see your doctor right away. Types of vasculitis Doctors divide vasculitis into types, based on the size of the blood vessels involved:","Doctors don’t know what causes many cases of vasculitis. It might be linked to an allergic reaction to a medication. You can also get it after having an infection that sets off an unusual response in your immune system, damaging your blood vessels. Vasculitis also may be tied to immune system diseases that you’ve had for months or years, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or Sjögren's syndrome.",Your doctor will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. You’ll need tests to look for inflammation or to rule out other conditions. These may include:,"Treatment depends on what’s causing your vasculitis and which organs are affected. Vasculitis might go away on its own if it’s the result of an allergic reaction. But if crucial organs such as your lungs, brain, or kidneys are involved, you need treatment right away.Your doctor will probably give you corticosteroid medications, also known as steroids, to fight inflammation. You might need to take them for a long time. Your doctor will watch you closely for side effects like high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and bone problems. Other medications can help slow your immune system with milder side effects than steroids. These include methotrexate (Rheumatrex,Trexall). A drug called tocilizumab (Actemra) blocks an inflammatory protein in your body. You might be able to use a lower dose of steroids if you take it at the same time. If you have anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, your doctor may prescribe avacopan (Tavneos)."
Venous Skin Ulcer,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/venous-skin-ulcer,"Venous ulcers happen when there’s a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well. That’s often because the valves that stop the flow of blood back into the veins aren’t working like they should. This backflow of blood means increased pressure in the end of the limb. When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle.","A venous ulcer often feels itchy or burns, and the leg around it may be swollen. Other signs may include: An ulcer can also become infected. If that happens, you might notice:","Venous ulcers happen when there’s a break in the skin on your leg, usually around the ankle. The veins in the leg, which should send blood back to the heart, might not be doing their job all that well.

When that happens, it can weaken the skin and make it harder for a cut or scrape to heal. They often occur over bony areas, such as your ankle.","If you have a wound that isn’t healing or you think is infected, you should see your doctor. Usually, all it takes is a quick examination of the sore and the skin around it to figure out whether you have a venous skin ulcer. Your doctor will ask you if you have a history of ongoing (or “chronic”) conditions, such as diabetes or hardening of the arteries.In some cases, however, your doctor might order other tests, such as an X-ray or a CT scan, to check out your veins and the area around the ulcer in more detail. Sometimes, an ulcer can lead to other problems, including serious skin and bone infections. And in rare cases, it can give rise to skin cancer.","The most common treatment is a compression bandage or stocking. The pressure should improve the blood circulation in your leg, boosting your body’s ability to heal the sore. Most ulcers heal after 3 or 4 months of treatment. However, some can take longer, and some may never clear up."
Ventricular Septal Defects,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ventricular-septal-defect,"Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart. This abnormality usually develops before birth and is found most often in infants. Normally, deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the upper chamber of the right side of the heart called the right atrium.  It passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen. After leaving the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, to the left atrium.  It then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to provide oxygen to all the tissues of the body.The ventricular septal defect may not be heard with a stethoscope until several days after birth. This is because a newborn's circulatory system changes during the first week, with a drop in the lung or pulmonary pressure creating the greater pressure differential between the 2 ventricles, which may increase the left-to-right shunt and produce an audible murmur. Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defects in infants","Small holes in the ventricular septum usually produce no symptoms but are often recognized by the child's health care provider when a loud heart murmur along the left side of the lower breast bone or sternum is heard. Large holes typically produce symptoms 1-6 months after an infant’s birth. The left ventricle begins to fail, producing the following symptoms: When a ventricular septal defect is not detected early in life, it can cause more severe problems and more severe symptoms as time goes on. The biggest concern is development of high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). If the ventricular septal defect is not surgically closed, irreversible pulmonary hypertension can develop, and the child may no longer benefit from surgery. The following are typical symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: The skin turns faintly bluish when the tissues are not receiving quite enough oxygen. This condition is often termed ""hypoxemia"" or ""hypoxia.""","No one knows what causes ventricular septal defects, but they probably come from a malformation of the heart that occurs while the infant is developing in the womb. The most common type of ventricular septal defect is the membranous variant. In this type, the hole is located below the aortic valve, which controls flow of blood from the left ventricle into the main artery of the body, the aorta.","If a ventricular septal defect is noted before your baby leaves the hospital, several tests may be ordered before discharge.A ventricular septal defect is detected on physical examination by a systolic murmur audible with a stethoscope along the lower left sternal or breast bone border. It is related to the oxygenated blood “swishing” through the hole or VSD into the right ventricle. The presence of a hole in the heart can be confirmed by echocardiogram. This painless test uses ultrasound waves to construct a moving picture of the heart. It can quantitate the size of the left-to-right shunt by enlargement of the left ventricle, pressure in the lungs, and actually estimate the degree of shunting by an empirical formula. Chest X-ray is useful to see if the overall heart size is enlarged, and may demonstrate evidence of fluid in the lungs or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram is helpful to evaluate the sizes of the left and right ventricle.  If right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated, this may suggest pulmonary hypertension.   Cardiac catheterization may be performed in certain circumstances.","If a larger ventricular septal defect is causing symptoms, your child's health care provider may prescribe medication."
Ventricular Tachycardia,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/atrial-fibrillation/what-is-ventricular-tachycardia,"Ventricular tachycardia is an unusually fast heartbeat that starts in the lower part of your heart, the ventricles. It’s sometimes called VT or V-tach. What is a normal heartbeat? Your heart is a muscular pump with four chambers. The two upper ones are called the atria. The two lower ones are called the ventricles. They work together to pump blood throughout your body. Every day, a healthy heart beats about 100,000 times. Your heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals. These signals follow a pattern. They start in the sinoatrial (SA) node. It’s in one of your atria and is often called your heart’s natural pacemaker. The signal causes your atria to contract so blood moves into your ventricles. It then moves down to another part of your heart called the atrioventricular (AV) node. This tells your ventricles to contract and move the blood along. What happens in ventricular tachycardia? When you have VT, the electrical signals in your ventricles take over and make your heart beat quickly. The pulses coming from your SA node are also affected.Most regular heart rates are in the range of 60 to 100 beats a minute. Ventricular tachycardia can result in rates of 170 beats a minute or even more. When this happens, your heart’s upper chambers don’t have time to refill and send that blood to the ventricles. So your blood doesn’t get pumped throughout your body the way it should. In some instances, this condition can lead to ventricular fibrillation, a condition that causes very rapid and uneven heartbeats of 300 or more a minute. It is a life-threatening emergency.","You may not notice any symptoms, especially if your heart beats fast for only a few seconds. VT can cause: When should I call a doctor? See your doctor as soon as possible if you’ve felt lightheaded or dizzy, had rapid heartbeats, or have fainted. Call 911 if you have chest pain and trouble breathing along with a very fast pulse.","You’re more likely to have ventricular tachycardia if you’re older or if someone in your family has a heart rhythm problem. Other conditions that can cause VT or raise your chances of it include: When doctors can’t find a cause, it’s called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.","Your doctor will review your medical history and symptoms. You’ll also have some tests of your heart. The first one you’ll probably get is called an EKG. It records your heart’s electrical activity. Your doctor may also want you to get electrophysiology testing, which pinpoints problem areas in your heart.","You may not need to do anything if you don’t have symptoms or if episodes last less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, your treatment will depend on what’s causing the problem. If a medication or caffeine is causing the VT, you might need to stop taking it. Other treatments include:  "
Verruca,https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/seborrheic-dermatitis-medref,"Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin disease that causes an itchy rash with flaky scales. It causes redness on light skin and light patches on darker skin. It’s also called dandruff, cradle cap, seborrhea, seborrheic eczema, and seborrheic psoriasis. It might look similar to psoriasis, eczema, or an allergic reaction. It usually happens on your scalp, but you can get it anywhere on your body.","Babies 3 months and younger often get cradle cap: crusty yellow or brown scales on their scalp. It usually goes away before they're a year old, although it can come back when they reach puberty. Parents might mistake seborrheic dermatitis for diaper rash. Adults might get seborrheic dermatitis on their face, especially around their nose, in their eyebrows, on their eyelids, or behind their ears. It can show up on other parts of your body, too: Your skin might itch or burn. The scales that flake off could be white or yellowish and look moist or oily. Because seborrheic dermatitis can look like other skin conditions, see your doctor to get a diagnosis and a treatment plan.",Newborns and adults ages 30 to 60 are more likely to get seborrheic dermatitis. It's more common in men than women and in people with oily skin. These conditions can also raise adults’ risk:  ,Your doctor will ask about your medical history and look at your skin. They might scrape off a bit of skin and look at it under a microscope to rule out conditions that affect your skin including:,"Seborrheic dermatitis will sometimes clear up by itself. But often, it's a lifelong issue that clears and flares. You can usually control it with good skin care.Talk with your doctor about a treatment plan. They’ll probably tell you to start with over-the-counter medicines and home remedies. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your scalp, use an over-the-counter dandruff shampoo with one of these ingredients: If your baby has cradle cap, shampoo their scalp daily with warm water and baby shampoo. A dandruff shampoo could irritate their skin, so talk to your pediatrician about medicated shampoos before you try one. To soften thick patches, rub mineral oil onto the area and brush gently with a baby hairbrush to help peel the scales off. If you have seborrheic dermatitis on your face and body, keep the affected areas clean. Wash with soap and water every day. Sunlight may stop the growth of the yeast organisms that are causing the problem, so being outdoors could help make the rash go away. Make sure to wear sunscreen."
Vertigo,https://www.webmd.com/brain/dizziness-vertigo,"Does it feel like you're spinning or the room is moving around you? That's a classic sign of a particular type of dizziness called vertigo. It's more than feeling off-kilter and usually gets worse when you move your head. This is a symptom that there is an issue in the inner ear or part of the brainstem governing balance. The most common kind is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV.Your inner ear is a complicated system of canals filled with fluid. These let your brain know how your head is moving. With BPPV, tiny bits of calcium in part of your inner ear get loose and move to places they don't belong. The system doesn't work the way it should and sends your brain the wrong signals. It's often caused by the natural breakdown of cells that happens with age. A head injury can cause it, too. You'll feel it briefly when you tilt or turn your head, and especially when you roll over in bed or sit up. BPPV isn't serious and usually goes away on its own. If not -- or you'd like to help it along -- it can be treated with special head exercises (""particle repositioning exercises"") called the Epley maneuver to get the pieces of calcium back in place. Most people feel better after one to three treatments. There are other causes of vertigo both in and outside the brain. You can have Meniere disease (described below), labyrinthitis (described below), a tumor called an acoustic neuroma or side effects from some antibiotics. In the brain, it can be caused by a vestibular migraine, multiple sclerosis, malformations of brain structures or a stroke from lack of blood flow or bleed (hemorrhage) in the cerebellum.",,,,

This is likely if you follow a strict vegan diet, because most of the natural sources are animal-based, including fish and fish oils, egg yolks, fortified milk, and beef liver. Here are the best vitamin d foods for vegetarians. Your exposure to sunlight is limited. Because the body makes vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight, you may be at risk of deficiency if you are homebound, live in northern latitudes, wear long robes or head coverings for religious reasons, or have an occupation that prevents sun exposure. During the winter, vitamin D deficiency can be more prevalent because there is less sunlight available.You have dark skin. The pigment melanin reduces the skin's ability to make vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure. Some studies show that older adults with darker skin are at high risk of vitamin D deficiency.",The most accurate way to measure how much vitamin D is in your body is the 25-hydroxy vitamin D blood test. A level of 20 nanograms/milliliter to 50 ng/mL is considered adequate for healthy people. A level less than 12 ng/mL indicates vitamin D deficiency.,"Treatment for vitamin D deficiency involves getting more vitamin D -- through diet and supplements. Although there is no consensus on vitamin D levels required for optimal health -- and it likely differs depending on age and health conditions -- a concentration of less than 20 nanograms per milliliter is generally considered inadequate, requiring treatment. Guidelines from the Institute of Medicine increased the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin D to 600 international units (IU) for everyone ages 1-70, and raised it to 800 IU for adults older than age 70 to optimize bone health. The safe upper limit was also raised to 4,000 IU. Doctors may prescribe more than 4,000 IU to correct a vitamin D deficiency. If you don't spend much time in the sun or always are careful to cover your skin (sunscreen inhibits vitamin D production), you should speak to your doctor about taking a vitamin D supplement, particularly if you have risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.If you shun the sun, wear sunscreen, suffer from milk allergies, or adhere to a strict vegan diet, you may be at risk for vitamin D deficiency. Known as the sunshine vitamin, vitamin D is produced by the body in response to skin being exposed to sunlight. It also occurs naturally in a few foods -- including some fish, fish liver oils, and egg yolks -- and in fortified dairy and grain products.   Vitamin D is essential for strong bones because it helps the body use calcium from the diet. Traditionally, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with rickets, a disease in which the bone tissue doesn't properly mineralize, leading to soft bones and skeletal deformities.

Which treatment may work best for you depends on how old you are, how much skin needs improving, and how much your vitiligo affects you.Medications for vitiligo The FDA has approvedruxolitinib (Opzelura) cream for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. It has shown success in repigmentation when applied twice daily for 6 months on vitiligo areas up to 10% body surface area. Otherwise, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream to put on affected skin to try to give it its color back. It may take months to see changes in your skin. You might also see some streaks or lines on your skin, or your skin may get thinner. If your vitiligo is progressing quickly, your doctor might suggest a corticosteroid pill or injection. In rare cases, they may suggest an ointment called a calcineurin inhibitor ointment. It affects your immune system to ease inflammation. You might get it if your vitiligo is in a small area, usually around your face and neck. Doctors don't prescribe these often, as these medicines are linked to skin cancer and lymphoma."

Von Recklinghausen's Neurofibromatosis,https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/neurofibromatosis,"Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system. Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet. You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis-pheochromocytoma-duodenal carcinoid syndrome, or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin. It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities. NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2.",Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms The following symptoms appear in people with NF1: Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms People with NF2 often display the following symptoms: Schwannomatosis symptoms People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms:  ,"Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include:  ","Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including: To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features:To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have: or Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria: ","There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment.

Von Willebrand's Disease,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/von-willebrand-disease-vwd,"It depends on what type of von Willebrand disease you have. With Type 1 and Type 2, your symptoms can range from mild to moderate. They include: If you’re a woman with VWD, you’ll have periods with clots larger than an inch in diameter. This means you may need to change your pad or tampon more than every hour. You’ll also likely develop anemia (low iron in the blood). These are symptoms of von Willebrand disease, but by themselves, they don’t prove you have VWD. With Type 3, you may have all the symptoms of Type 1 and Type 2, plus episodes of severe bleeding for no reason. You also might experience severe pain and swelling in your soft tissues and joints because of bleeding.","It depends on what type of von Willebrand disease you have.

You also might experience severe pain and swelling in your soft tissues and joints because of bleeding.","Most of the time, you inherit VWD from one or both parents. You can inherit Type 1 or Type 2 if one of your parents passes the gene on to you. You usually only get Type 3 if both of your parents pass the gene to you. It’s possible to have the gene that causes the disorder but not have any symptoms. In that case, you can still pass the gene to your children. ",,"There’s no cure for von Willebrand disease, but it can be treated and/or managed. A key to managing this disorder is to reduce the risk of bleeding before it starts. This means avoiding certain drugs that can thin your blood. Your doctor might recommend you avoid aspirin and medications known as NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Acetominophen (Tylenol) is a good alternative to aspirin and NSAIDs.How your condition is treated will depend on how severe your symptoms are. With Type 1, you typically only need treatment if have you have surgery, a tooth extraction, or are injured. The most common treatment for von Willebrand disease is desmopressin acetate (DDAVP). It’s available as an injection or a nasal spray. DDAVP is a synthetic form of the hormone vasopressin. It causes the release of von Willebrand factor from your cells. A side effect of this hormone is that it causes your body to retain water. As a result, you will need to be on fluid restrictions if you’re taking the medication. Your doctor might also recommend that you get clotting factor concentrates through an IV. If you’re going to have a dental procedure, you may need to take aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid. These prevent the breakdown of blood clots. You take these medications by mouth, either in liquid or pill form. You may also take them if you're bleeding from your nose or mouth, or if you have heavy bleeding with your period."
VSD,https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/ventricular-septal-defect,"Ventricular septal defect is a hole in the wall between the right and left ventricles of the heart. This abnormality usually develops before birth and is found most often in infants. Normally, deoxygenated blood from the body returns to the upper chamber of the right side of the heart called the right atrium.  It passes through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, which pumps the blood to the lungs to absorb oxygen. After leaving the lungs, the oxygenated blood returns to the left side of the heart, to the left atrium.  It then passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, where it is pumped out to provide oxygen to all the tissues of the body.The ventricular septal defect may not be heard with a stethoscope until several days after birth. This is because a newborn's circulatory system changes during the first week, with a drop in the lung or pulmonary pressure creating the greater pressure differential between the 2 ventricles, which may increase the left-to-right shunt and produce an audible murmur. Ventricular septal defects are the most common congenital heart defects in infants","Small holes in the ventricular septum usually produce no symptoms but are often recognized by the child's health care provider when a loud heart murmur along the left side of the lower breast bone or sternum is heard. Large holes typically produce symptoms 1-6 months after an infant’s birth. The left ventricle begins to fail, producing the following symptoms: When a ventricular septal defect is not detected early in life, it can cause more severe problems and more severe symptoms as time goes on. The biggest concern is development of high pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension). If the ventricular septal defect is not surgically closed, irreversible pulmonary hypertension can develop, and the child may no longer benefit from surgery. The following are typical symptoms of pulmonary hypertension: The skin turns faintly bluish when the tissues are not receiving quite enough oxygen. This condition is often termed ""hypoxemia"" or ""hypoxia.""","No one knows what causes ventricular septal defects, but they probably come from a malformation of the heart that occurs while the infant is developing in the womb. The most common type of ventricular septal defect is the membranous variant. In this type, the hole is located below the aortic valve, which controls flow of blood from the left ventricle into the main artery of the body, the aorta.","If a ventricular septal defect is noted before your baby leaves the hospital, several tests may be ordered before discharge.A ventricular septal defect is detected on physical examination by a systolic murmur audible with a stethoscope along the lower left sternal or breast bone border. It is related to the oxygenated blood “swishing” through the hole or VSD into the right ventricle. The presence of a hole in the heart can be confirmed by echocardiogram. This painless test uses ultrasound waves to construct a moving picture of the heart. It can quantitate the size of the left-to-right shunt by enlargement of the left ventricle, pressure in the lungs, and actually estimate the degree of shunting by an empirical formula. Chest X-ray is useful to see if the overall heart size is enlarged, and may demonstrate evidence of fluid in the lungs or pulmonary congestion. An electrocardiogram is helpful to evaluate the sizes of the left and right ventricle.  If right ventricular hypertrophy is indicated, this may suggest pulmonary hypertension.   Cardiac catheterization may be performed in certain circumstances.","If a larger ventricular septal defect is causing symptoms, your child's health care provider may prescribe medication."
Vulvar Cancer,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/what-is-vulvar-cancer,"  Vulvar cancer is when cancerous cells grow out of control on or in the vulva, the outer part of a woman’s genitals. It’s different from vaginal cancer, which starts inside the vagina. A woman’s vulva includes:  ","You might not notice any symptoms early on. Over time, you might have: These can also be signs of other conditions, so talk to your doctor if you spot problems.",The exact causes of vulvar cancer aren’t clear. But certain things can raise your chances of getting it. These include:  ,Your appointment might include:  ,"Treatment depends on many things, including the type of cancer, how far it’s spread, and your overall health. The four main treatments are:  "
Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/lymphoma/waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia-overview,"If your doctor says you have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, it means you have a rare blood cancer that usually spreads slowly. It's also called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). This disease is a kind of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These are cancers that start in white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are a part of your immune system -- your body's defense against germs. Some lymphocytes are called ""B cells,"" which help your body fight off infections. They do this by turning into plasma cells that make a protein called immunoglobulin M. This protein attaches to germs and helps your immune system target them. In Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, something goes wrong with this process. The B cells turn into cancer cells, which means they grow out of control. These cancer cells form mainly in your bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of most bones. They crowd out healthy blood cells. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells can also cause problems because they make large amounts of immunoglobulin M. When this builds up, your blood can become thicker than usual. It's harder for your blood to move through your blood vessels.There's no cure for Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, but there are treatments that can help. Medicines can keep it under control, sometimes for many years. While you manage this disease, it's important to reach out to family and friends to get the backing you need. They can give you support while you get treatment and help you handle the emotional roller coaster that sometimes goes along with a cancer diagnosis.","You may not notice anything different. One in four people with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia don't have any symptoms when they're diagnosed. It's possible, though, that you may have a variety of health issues. As the cancer cells spread in your bone marrow, your healthy blood cell levels drop. Having fewer red blood cells causes a condition called anemia, which can leave you feeling tired. And if you have fewer white cells, it’s harder for your body to fight off infections. Your number of platelets -- blood cells that help you form clots -- may also drop. This can cause you to bleed or bruise more easily. And Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells in your organs can trigger swelling.Besides these problems, you may also get symptoms like:  ","Experts think that changes in your DNA may lead to the disease. Nine out of 10 times, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia cells have a change on a gene called MYD88. Researchers have also linked another gene, CXCR4, to the disease. Both genes help cells send signals to each other, so they stay alive. The DNA changes may cause the genes to get stuck in the ""on"" position, so cells live longer than they normally do. Scientists are studying what causes these DNA changes. They know that they aren't passed down from your parents. Most of the time, the changes happen later in life. This may explain why Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia is usually diagnosed in older people. The disease is more common in men than women. Your chances of having Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia are higher if you:  ","Your doctor will start by asking questions about your health history and do a physical exam. They may check for swelling in your lymph nodes, liver, and spleen.Your doctor may also ask you to take tests, such as: Blood tests. Your doctor takes a sample of your blood and sends it to a lab, where technicians look at it under a microscope. Blood tests show if you have low levels of healthy blood cells. They can also check the amount of immunoglobulin M proteins in your blood. Blood tests also measure how well your organs are working. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. To confirm that you have Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, your doctor tests your bone marrow for cancer cells. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are done at your doctor's office or in a hospital.","Your doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on your symptoms and how much the cancer has spread.  If you don't have symptoms, your doctor may suggest a ""watch-and-wait"" approach. This means you won't get treatment, but they'll keep a close eye on your health. You may need to get blood tests every few months. It can be years before you need treatment.If you do have symptoms, your doctor may suggest one treatment or a combination of treatments: Chemotherapy. These drugs use powerful chemicals to kill cancer cells. You take them by mouth, or a doctor injects them into you. Biological therapy. You'll get medicines that help your immune system fight cancer cells. You might also use man-made versions of substances that your immune system makes. A doctor usually injects them into your body. Targeted therapy. These are drugs that block certain proteins or enzymes that help the cancer cells grow. The medicine often comes in pill form. Plasma exchange. Your doctor may want you to lower your levels of immunoglobulin M. To do this, you may need a plasma exchange. In this treatment, you're hooked up to an IV. Your blood is filtered through a machine that separates the liquid part of your blood, called plasma, from the blood cells, to remove immunoglobulin M. Healthy plasma gets swapped in."
Wandering Rash Tongue,https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/geographic-tongue,"Geographic tongue is a condition that gets its name from patches that look like a map on the top and sides of your tongue. You can also have it in other areas of your mouth. Doctors sometimes call it benign migratory glossitis. The patches can come and go or change very quickly over days, weeks, or months. You might have them for up to a year. Geographic tongue is benign, which means it’s harmless. It isn't linked to an infection or cancer.

This is often because of things like:","Geographic tongue happens when parts of your tongue are missing layers of papillae. Doctors aren’t sure exactly why you lose them. However, because geographic tongue tends to run in families, it might have something to do with your genes. Geographic tongue is also more common in people who have psoriasis or cracks and grooves on the top and sides of their tongue (fissured tongue). Geographic tongue affects about 1% to 3% of people.

Water on the Brain (Hydrocephalus),https://www.webmd.com/brain/normal-pressure-hydrocephalus,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a condition that happens when you have too much of a certain kind of fluid in parts of your brain. Your brain and spinal cord are surrounded by a clear liquid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It’s made and stored in cavities in your brain called ventricles. It circulates around your brain, moving from ventricle to ventricle. It cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord, supplies them with nutrients, and removes some of their waste products. Extra fluid usually drains away from the brain and is absorbed by veins at the top of the brain. Hydrocephalus happens when the natural system for draining and absorbing extra CSF doesn’t work right. The ventricles enlarge to accommodate the extra fluid and then press on different parts of the brain, causing a number of different symptoms. Hydrocephalus has many different causes. Some people are born with the condition, while others develop it during their lives. Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a type of hydrocephalus that usually happens in older adults. The average age of a person with NPH is over age 60. NPH is different from other types of hydrocephalus in that it develops slowly over time. There is an abnormal buildup of CSF over time and the drainage is blocked gradually. The extra fluid builds up slowly. It causes the ventricles to enlarge slowly and the fluid pressure in the brain may not be as high as in other types of hydrocephalus. However, the enlarged ventricles still press on the brain and can cause symptoms (the term ""normal pressure"" is somewhat misleading).The parts of the brain most often affected in NPH are those that control the legs, the bladder, and the ""cognitive"" mental processes such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, and speaking. This decline in mental processes, if it is severe enough to interfere with everyday activities, is known as dementia. Other symptoms include abnormal gait (difficulty walking), inability to hold urine (urinary incontinence), and, occasionally, inability to control the bowels. The dementia symptoms of NPH can be similar to those of Alzheimer's disease. The walking problems are similar to those of Parkinson's disease. Experts say that many cases of NPH are misdiagnosed as one of these diseases. Unlike Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, NPH can be reversed in many people with appropriate treatment. But first it must be correctly diagnosed.","At first, the symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus are usually very subtle. They worsen very gradually. Symptoms of dementia include: Urinary symptoms The following symptoms can be related to increased pressure in the brain: Some people think that memory loss, difficulty finding words, walking problems, or urination problems are normal parts of aging. In many cases, however, these are symptoms of treatable conditions. Any of these problems, or changes in mood or behavior, warrants a visit to your health care provider.","In most cases, the cause of NPH isn’t known, but several things can lead to it, including: How these conditions lead to NPH is not clear.","The symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus can also happen in people with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. However, the combination of dementia-like symptoms, walking problems, and urinary problems should alert your health care provider to the possibility of NPH. Making the distinction is very important because the treatments for these conditions are different. No lab test can tell if you have NPH, but other kinds of tests can diagnose NPH.At any point in this process, your health care provider may refer you to a specialist in brain disorders (neurologist or neurosurgeon) to complete the evaluation and begin treatment. The evaluation begins with a medical interview, when your doctor will ask about:","Normal pressure hydrocephalus can sometimes be managed or possibly even reversed through surgery. For those who are not candidates for surgery, treatment consists of measures to relieve mood and behavioral problems, cope with physical problems such as incontinence and walking difficulties, and maximize physical, mental, and social functioning.Surgery for normal pressure hydrocephalus Normal pressure hydrocephalus is not caused by any structural abnormality. In most cases, the underlying problem is not known or cannot be treated. The treatment in these cases is a shunt operation. A shunt is a thin tube that is implanted in the brain by a neurosurgeon. It is inserted into the ventricles to drain excess CSF away from the brain. The tube is routed under the skin from the head to another part of the body, usually the peritoneum (the lower belly). The shunt is equipped with a valve that opens to release fluid when the pressure builds up. The fluid drains harmlessly and is later absorbed by the bloodstream. The pressure setting on the valve sometimes must be readjusted. The newer shunts allow adjustment without another operation."

Weaning,https://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/after-nursing,"When you're nursing, the flow of milk can stretch your breast skin and tissue. That leaves some women with an ""empty"" or ""stretched out"" look to their breasts when the milk-producing structures shrink to the size they were before you got pregnant. It's a common cosmetic breast problem after breastfeeding, but it isn't a medical concern. Women often fear that breastfeeding will make their breasts sag. But other factors can change your breast appearance more than breastfeeding. These include:",,"Each breast is independent. So what happens to one breast during breastfeeding won't necessarily happen to the other. Breast engorgement, or painful overfilling of the breasts with milk is a common condition that may leave one breast slightly misshapen afterward, for instance. Or one breast may produce more milk than the other, contributing to asymmetry of the breasts. Any dimpling or puckering of your breast may be a sign of a breast lump underneath and should be checked by your doctor.",,"When breast size or shape changes a lot after breastfeeding, some women consider cosmetic surgery. A breast lift, called a mastopexy, can be performed to help sagging and to reposition the nipple and areola (the dark circle around the nipple) higher on the breast. A thorough evaluation by a qualified cosmetic surgeon, including a complete breast health history, is advised before you consider surgery.The wonderful bond you create with your baby when you breastfeed is like no other. And experts agree that breast milk is ideal for your infant. But even though you want to give your baby the best start you can, you can't help but be concerned. What will nursing do to your breasts? Think of their size and shape, for example. Throughout your life -- and especially during pregnancy and breastfeeding -- the size and shape of your breasts can change. Breast size is determined by how much fatty tissue there is. Making milk creates denser tissue in your breasts. After breastfeeding, both the fatty tissue and connective tissue in your breasts may shift. Your breasts may or may not return to their pre-breastfeeding size or shape. Some women's breasts stay large, and others shrink. But sagging or staying full can be as much a result of genetics, weight gain during pregnancy, and age as a result of breastfeeding."

Many doctors think of them as different stages of the same disease. They can happen if you don’t get enough vitamin B1, also called thiamine. Vitamin B1 helps your brain turn sugar into energy. When your brain and nervous system don’t get the amount they need, they don’t work as well. Wernicke encephalopathy typically comes on suddenly, and you’ll need treatment right away. Symptoms include confusion, loss of muscle coordination, and trouble with your vision. Korsakoff syndrome happens more slowly. It’s a long-term, ongoing problem that damages the part of your brain that handles memory.","The main signs of Wernicke encephalopathy are:You also may have problems with your heart and blood vessels that can lead to: If you aren’t treated for Wernicke encephalopathy quickly, it can lead to Korsakoff syndrome. Symptoms of Korsakoff syndrome usually begin as the signs of Wernicke encephalopathy start to go away. The telltale sign is the loss of short-term memory. That also makes it hard for you to learn anything new or make new memories. You might talk to someone and seem like yourself. But a minute or two later, you won’t remember anything about it, not even who you spoke with. You may also have:  ","In many cases, the lack of vitamin B1 is caused by heavy, long-term alcohol use. Over time, alcohol affects how well your body absorbs, stores, and uses it.It also can happen if you don’t get enough nutrients from your diet or if you have certain health problems. These other causes include: Men get Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome a little more often than women, and it typically happens in people ages 45-65. It's also more common in: These groups are more likely to abuse alcohol or not eat well.","Typically, it’s based on a physical exam, your health history, and some tests. Your doctor will also want to rule out other problems that could cause your symptoms. You may get:  ","The first step is to get plenty of vitamin B1. You’ll probably have it put directly into a vein through a needle in your hand or arm (an IV). You might need to have this every day for several months. From there, it’s important to stay away from alcohol and eat a balanced diet. That’ll help keep symptoms from coming back. If it affects how you walk, you’ll likely need physical therapy."

Winter Blues or Depression,https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/seasonal-affective-disorder,"While we don't know the exact causes of SAD, some scientists think that certain hormones made deep in the brain trigger attitude-related changes at certain times of year.

When nerve cell pathways in the brain that regulate mood don't work the way they should, the result can be feelings of depression, along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain.SAD usually starts in young adulthood and is more common in women than men. Some people with SAD have mild symptoms and feel out of sorts or cranky. Others have worse symptoms that interfere with relationships and work.

The condition can cause symptoms throughout your life, but treatments and continued research help people manage their condition.","Signs of Turner syndrome can start even before birth, and they give parents some idea that their baby might be born with the condition. An ultrasound of a baby with it may show heart and kidney problems or a buildup of fluid.A DNA test using a blood sample from the mother can also screen for Turner syndrome before birth.","Turner syndrome happens when a female is missing certain genes that are normally on the X chromosome. (Females have two X chromosomes. Males have an X and a Y). Some girls with Turner are actually missing a whole copy of the X chromosome. For others, just part of one containing the particular set of genes is missing. The different ways genes can be affected include: Monosomy. A problem with the mom’s egg or dad’s sperm causes an absence of the X chromosome in every cell of the body. Mosaicism. When cell division during early stages of fetal development doesn’t happen correctly, some cells in the body get two complete copies of the X chromosome. Other cells have only one copy.X chromosome abnormalities. Cells have one complete copy and one abnormal or missing copy of the X chromosome. Y chromosome material. In a few cases, some cells get one copy of the X chromosome and other cells get one copy of the X chromosome and some Y chromosome material. Biologically, you develop as a female. The Y chromosome material increases your risk of a type of cancer called gonadoblastoma. About 70,000 U.S. women and girls live with it. Research has found that almost 99% of babies missing the chromosome are miscarried. But about 1% of the time, these babies are born, and they have the syndrome.","If an ultrasound shows something abnormal while you’re pregnant, your doctor may want to examine your baby’s chromosomes with a karyotype. This test compares chromosomes by lining them up. To get samples from you, your doctor may recommend: If a diagnosis isn’t made before or at birth, other lab tests that check hormones, thyroid function and blood sugar can help diagnose it. Because of the problems linked to Turner syndrome, doctors will also often suggest tests for the kidneys, heart, and hearing.","Medical care often calls for a team of specialists that’s built around the specific needs of each person, because the cases vary so widely. There’s no cure, but most girls will take the same main therapies during childhood and the teen years. These are: Almost all women with the condition need fertility treatments to become pregnant.

Though yeast infections can happen to anyone at any time, there are certain things that make getting them more likely. Most infections can be cleared up quickly and easily. The vagina normally contains a healthy balance of bacteria and yeast. The hormone estrogen helps bacteria called lactobacilli to grow. These bacteria kill harmful organisms in the vagina and keep you healthy.

Plus, regular walking and movement can help prevent falls by keeping your muscles strong and maintaining your balance.How can I improve my mobility? The best thing you can do is get physically active. Do a combination of aerobic exercise to get your heart pumping (like walking or swimming), resistance exercises to build and maintain your muscles (like lifting weights), and stretching to improve your flexibility. You’re never too old to start exercising. No matter what your age, when you start an exercise program, you’ll benefit.

People who have ZES develop tumors known as gastrinomas in the pancreas and duodenum (the first section of the small intestine). The gastrinomas caused by ZES secrete the hormone gastrin.

ZES,https://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/zollinger-ellison-syndrome,"Gastrinomas tend to grow slowly and are not always malignant. The five-year survival rate depends on whether tumors are cancerous and if they've spread. If they have not spread to the liver, the 5-year survival rate may be 90%.

Zika,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/zika-virus-symptoms-prevention,"Zika causes microcephaly in babies born to infected pregnant women, the CDC says. Microcephaly stunts a baby’s head growth, causing devastating, sometimes fatal brain damage, and it can result in miscarriage or stillbirth.The virus has caused panic in Brazil since it first appeared there in May 2015. More than 2,100 babies in Brazil have been born with microcephaly or other birth defects linked to Zika. at the time, Brazil and several other nations advised women to postpone pregnancy.","The disease can cause fever, rash, joint pain, and redness in the whites of the eye (conjunctivitis, or pinkeye). But most people won’t know they have it. “Only about 1 in 5 people with the virus will exhibit symptoms,” says Adalja. “The vast majority have no symptoms at all.” Symptoms can appear anywhere from 3 to 14 days after a bite from an infected mosquito, according to the CDC. They can last from several days to about a week.Call your doctor if you develop symptoms and you live in or have visited an area where Zika is spreading, the CDC says -- especially if you are pregnant. Pregnant women who have Zika symptoms at any point during their pregnancy should be tested for Zika. Once a person has been infected, scientists believe they are probably protected from future infections.","Since 2018, no local mosquito-borne virus transmission has been reported in the continental United States. The CDC says that detecting local spread of Zika is difficult, as a person may not show symptoms for up to 2 weeks after infection, if at all. In addition, diagnosis and investigation of cases can take weeks. Aedes mosquitoes, which spread Zika, are found in every country in North, Central, and South America except for two: Canada and continental Chile, according to the WHO's Regional Office for the Americas. ","There are two ways to test for Zika. One test looks for pieces of the virus’s genetic code in people with active infections. But after the body clears the infection, which takes about 2 weeks after symptoms appear, that test won’t work. The FDA has OK'd the emergency use of a more advanced version of this test that can distinguish whether a person has dengue, chikungunya, or Zika, rather than having to do three different tests. The new version is in qualified labs, the CDC says. Since 80% of people with Zika don’t have symptoms, many people don’t know when they were infected and would not be eligible for this test. Another test looks for proteins called antibodies made by the immune system to fight the virus. It can find antibodies in the blood up to 3 months after a person is infected. But this test isn’t very specific. It may mistakenly show a person has had Zika if they’ve been infected with other viruses, including dengue and chikungunya. A positive or inconclusive test result means a follow-up test is done by the CDC or a CDC-authorized lab.The FDA has approved this test, and the CDC is distributing it to qualified labs. Testing of amniotic fluid in pregnant women can also be done, although it's not clear how well this test would work for Zika, according to the CDC.","There’s no treatment, but most people with symptoms do well with over-the-counter medications for aches and pains. The disease usually runs its course within a week or so. The CDC recommends infected people get plenty of rest, drink fluids to prevent dehydration, and take acetaminophen for fever and pain. Aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be taken until dengue is ruled out, to reduce bleeding risk, the agency says. There is no vaccine against Zika, but the National Institutes of Health is testing one in humans."
