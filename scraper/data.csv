GVHD,https://www.webmd.com/cancer/multiple-myeloma/graft-versus-host-disease,"GVHD can show up in several different parts of your body. Usually, it affects your skin, digestive system, or liver. It often starts as an itchy rash on your palms and the soles of your feet. You may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some of these symptoms can be side effects of the transplant or of procedures or medications that go along with it. They can also mean you have an infection. Your doctor may take a sample of tissue, called a biopsy, from the affected part of your body to find out. A specialist will look for signs of GVHD in the sample under a microscope.There are two main types, based on when symptoms show up. Acute GVHD usually happens within 100 days of the transplant. Chronic GVHD usually appears later. You're more likely to get the chronic form if you've had the acute form, and sometimes the two happen at the same time. Beyond the timing, differences in symptoms help determine what kind you have. With acute GVHD, you may have: A rash and digestive problems are also symptoms of chronic GVHD. But it involves other parts of your body, too. You may have: GVHD is broken into different stages and grades based on how bad the symptoms are. These stages and grades help doctors decide how to treat it and can be a sign of how likely you are to recover.","GVHD can show up in several different parts of your body.

A transplant of someone else's bone marrow or stem cells lets your body make new blood cells. But with GVHD, donor immune cells can attack your healthy cells as if they were bacteria or a virus. You're most likely to get it if your proteins which protect your body's cells don't match your donor's very well. Other things that can increase your risk include: The more closely your cells match those of your donor, the better. Unless you have an identical twin, your best match will be a sibling or parent. But you may find a good match in a national registry. The risk also goes down if doctors get the donor cells from umbilical cord blood rather than peripheral blood or bone marrow. Certain medications taken before and after the transplant can help prevent GVHD. You'll get a combination of drugs that slow down your immune system to keep the new white blood cells from going on the attack.",,"If your GVHD is severe enough to need treatment, your doctor probably will prescribe a combination of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and drugs that slow down your immune system, such as cyclosporine. Those can make it harder for your body to fight infections, so you may also get prophylactic antibiotics. If the problem persists, your doctor may prescribe a kinase inhibitor. Other treatments can help you manage the symptoms in specific parts of your body. GVHD usually goes away a year or so after the transplant, when your body starts to make its own white blood cells from the donor cells. But some people have to manage it for many years.If you've had a bone marrow or stem cell transplant, you'll want to watch for signs of graft versus host disease (GVHD). It's a common complication -- as many as 4 out of 5 people who get a transplant get it in some form.  It happens when the cells that come from a donor mistakenly attack your own cells. Its effects can range from mild to life-threatening. A mild case of GVHD can be a good sign. If the donor immune cells attack your healthy cells, they're also fighting any leftover cancer cells. Your doctor may decide it's best not to treat it."
Lymphedema,https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-lymphedema,"If your lymphatic system is damaged or a blockage exists, the fluid can build up in the soft tissue beneath your skin. There are two types of lymphedema: Secondary lymphedema is caused by another condition or disease that damages your lymph vessels or nodes. Secondary lymphedema may be caused by: Primary lymphedema is much less common. It’s a genetic problem that happens because your lymph nodes or vessels either aren't adequately developed or are missing altogether.","The most common symptom of lymphedema is swelling in one or both arms or legs. This swelling, which can extend into the fingers or toes, usually develops gradually over time. At first, the swelling is soft and fluid. In time, it can become more dense and fibrous, and it may make your skin look grainy. You could also have pain, heaviness, or limited range of motion in the affected limb, which may make it hard to exercise or do other activities. Over time, these symptoms may lead to other problems including infection, and in rare cases, cancer. If swelling in your arm or leg doesn’t go away, you should see your doctor.","If your lymphatic system is damaged or a blockage exists, the fluid can build up in the soft tissue beneath your skin.

It’s a genetic problem that happens because your lymph nodes or vessels either aren't adequately developed or are missing altogether.","Your doctor will want to know about your medical history. You may also get imaging tests to help diagnose the problem. A lymphoscintigraphy is a scan that can detect blockages or missing lymph vessels. It is done by injecting radioactive material. Other tests to investigate the cause of your swelling include MRI, CT scan, and ultrasound.","Your doctor may recommend:Lymphedema is swelling that’s caused by a collection of too much lymph fluid. It usually happens in your arms and legs, but it can happen in other parts of your body, as well. This swelling may cause pain and limit how well the affected area moves. Lymph is a protein-rich fluid that moves throughout your body in lymph vessels. It scoops up things like bacteria, viruses, and waste, and carries them to your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes then filter the fluid to get the impurities out of your body. You could get lymphedema for any number of reasons. There are treatments to help bring down the swelling so you feel and move better."
