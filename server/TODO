Retreive EHR

Process to obtain Embeddings:
1. Prepare the data csv file with the data sections from scraping 
2. Start with a small subset of the data csv file
3. Use this code to get the embeddings and save them locally for reuse - https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Obtain_dataset.ipynb
4. Review this doc for model (use second gen model), tokenizer, max input tokens and output dimensions - https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings

Process to get started with Redis vector database and openai:
5. To retreive K nearest embedding vectors quickly with Redis vector database use this cookbook - https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/vector_databases/redis
6. For step by step setup of Redis as a vector databsae with openai use this - https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/vector_databases/redis/getting-started-with-redis-and-openai.ipynb
7. To run Redis locally - https://discord.com/channels/877056448956346408/1078380774811779202/1078794343692906656
8. To run Redis in the cloud - https://discord.com/channels/877056448956346408/1078380774811779202/1078796458934927391
